5/12/2023 10:00,The Best Air Fryers for Quick and Easy Cooking,"KEEP HEARING ABOUT the joys of air frying? Providing a faster and healthier way to cook fried foods with little to no oil, an air fryer has become something of a kitchen staple. It works much like a convection oven to circulate hot air around your food—only it’s more compact and increases your time savings. Think guilt-free crispy chicken, homemade fries, and donuts that are not only simple to make, but come with easier clean-up compared to using a traditional deep-fat fryer.

With smaller capacity interiors to heat and shorter preheating times, an air fryer can be a quicker way to cook than your standard oven too—potentially saving you money off your energy bills if used wisely. (Just make sure it’s large enough to cook what you need, otherwise you’ll be using it multiple times—which will defeat its energy-saving purpose.) Multifunctional in design, some air fryers come loaded with preset cooking modes for baking, roasting, dehydrating, grilling, and reheating. They can tackle a range of meat, fish, and vegetables effectively, as well as sweet treats: think steak and sweet potato fries, homemade apple crisps and a warm banana loaf. Here are WIRED's top picks to suit a range of ingredients and price points.

5/12/2023 9:00,You’re Probably Underestimating AI Chatbots,"IN THE SPRING of 2007, I was one of four journalists anointed by Steve Jobs to review the iPhone. This was probably the most anticipated product in the history of tech. What would it be like? Was it a turning point for devices? Looking back at my review today, I am relieved to say it’s not an embarrassment: I recognized the device’s generational significance. But for all the praise I bestowed upon the iPhone, I failed to anticipate its mind-blowing secondary effects, such as the volcanic melding of hardware, operating system, and apps, or its hypnotic effect on our attention. (I did urge Apple to “encourage outside developers to create new uses” for the device.) Nor did I suggest we should expect the rise of services like Uber or TikTok or make any prediction that family dinners would turn into communal display-centric trances. Of course, my primary job was to help people decide whether to spend $500, which was super expensive for a phone back then, to buy the damn thing. But reading the review now, one might wonder why I spent time griping about AT&T’s network or the web browser’s inability to handle Flash content. That’s like quibbling over what sandals to wear just as a three-story tsunami is about to break.

I am reminded of my failure of foresight when reading about the experiences people are having with recent AI apps, like large language model chatbots and AI image generators. Quite rightfully, people are obsessing about the impact of a sudden cavalcade of shockingly capable AI systems, though scientists often note that these seemingly rapid breakthroughs have been decades in the making. But as when I first pawed the iPhone in 2007, we risk failing to anticipate the potential trajectories of our AI-infused future by focusing too much on the current versions of products like Microsoft’s Bing chat, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Bard.

This fallacy can be clearly observed in what has become a new and popular media genre, best described as prompt-and-pronounce. The modus operandi is to attempt some task formerly limited to humans and then, often disregarding the caveats provided by the inventors, take it to an extreme. The great sports journalist Red Smith once said that writing a column is easy—you just open a vein and bleed. But would-be pundits now promote a bloodless version: You just open a browser and prompt. (Note: this newsletter was produced the old-fashioned way, by opening a vein.)

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Typically, prompt-and-pronounce columns involve sitting down with one of these way-early systems and seeing how well it replaces something previously limited to the realm of the human. In a typical example, a New York Times reporter used ChatGPT to answer all her work communications for an entire week. The Wall Street Journal’s product reviewer decided to clone her voice (hey, we did that first!) and appearance using AI to see if her algorithmic doppelgängers could trick people into mistaking the fake for the real thing. There are dozens of similar examples.

Generally, those who stage such stunts come to two conclusions: These models are amazing, but they fall miserably short of what humans do best. The emails fail to pick up workplace nuances. The clones have one foot dragging in the uncanny valley. Most damningly, these text generators make things up when asked for factual information, a phenomenon known as “hallucinations”' that is the current bane of AI. And it’s a plain fact that the output of today’s models often have a soulless quality. 

In one sense, it’s scary—will our future world be run by flawed “mind children,” as roboticist Hans Moravec calls our digital successors? But in another sense, the shortcomings are comforting. Sure, AIs can now perform a lot of low-level tasks and are unparalleled at suggesting plausible-looking Disneyland trips and gluten-free dinner party menus, but—the thinking goes—the bots will always need us to make corrections and jazz up the prose.",https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-youre-probably-underestimating-ai-chatbots/,,,,,,,,
,What Do a Falling Apple and an Orbiting Moon Have in Common?,"IF YOU DROP an object, it will fall. It's a motion that we’ve all seen hundreds of times. We’ve also all seen plenty of the moon, which makes one complete orbit around our planet every 27.3 days (as seen from the Earth). Falling and orbiting may seem like radically different types of motion, but they’re not! The same physics explains them both.

There is a famous story about Isaac Newton making the connection thanks to a falling apple. (It's probably not true—but it might be.) Still, his realization is kind of amazing, so I'm going to walk you through the whole process. It includes some concepts that people living today might take for granted, but the building of knowledge like this isn't trivial, and Newton didn't figure everything out on his own. He built on ideas from Galileo, who studied the motion of falling objects, Robert Hooke, who explored the effects of things moving in circles, and Johannes Kepler, who produced ideas about the motions of the planets and moon.

Falling Objects

Let’s start with what happens to an object as it falls. In the third century BC, Aristotle asserted that a massive object will fall faster than a low-mass one. Sounds reasonable, right? That seems to fit with what we see—imagine dropping a rock and a feather at the same time. But Aristotle wasn't big on testing his theories with experiments. It just seemed to make sense that a heavier object falls faster. Like most of his philosopher peers, he preferred to come to conclusions based on armchair logic.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Aristotle also reasoned that objects fall at a constant speed, meaning they don’t slow down or speed up as they go. He probably arrived at this conclusion because dropped objects fall quickly, and it’s really hard to spot changes in speed with the naked eye.

But much later, Galileo Galilei (who went by his first name because he thought that was cool) came up with a way to slow things down. His solution was to roll a ball down a ramp instead of dropping it. Rolling the ball at a very slight angle makes it much easier to tell what's going on. It might look something like this:

VIDEO: RHETT ALLIN

Now we can see that as the ball rolls down the track, it increases in speed. Galileo suggested that during the first second of motion, the ball will increase in speed a certain amount. It will also increase by the same amount of speed in the next second of motion. That means that during the time interval between 1 and 2 seconds, the ball will travel a farther distance than it did in the first second.

He then suggested that the same thing happens as you increase the steepness of the angle, as it would produce a greater increase in speed. That must mean that an object on a completely vertical ramp (which would be the same as a falling object) would also increase in speed. Boom—Aristotle was wrong! Falling objects don't fall at a constant speed, but instead change speed. The rate at which the speed changes is called acceleration. On the surface of the Earth, a dropped object will accelerate downward at 9.8 meters per second per second.

We can write the acceleration mathematically as a change in velocity divided by the change in time (where the Greek symbol Δ indicates a change).",https://www.wired.com/story/what-do-a-falling-apple-and-an-orbiting-moon-have-in-common/,,,,,,,,
5/12/2023 9:00,Elvis Director Baz Luhrmann Doesn't Think AI Will Conquer Movies,"THE MONITOR IS a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to Twitter.

Baz Luhrmann blends in well here. The Australian writer, director, and producer is known for his flashy, hyper-realistic style, and on this particular New York night he’s in a sparse, brightly lit former taxi warehouse in Chelsea, talking to a robot. The bot’s name is Ai-Da; she’s a painter powered by artificial intelligence. (Yes, she identifies as female.) Before Luhrmann took the stage next to her, she was doing a watercolor while people gawked and took photos. “Did you see Elvis, Ai-Da?” he asked. She paused for an almost awkward period before replying. Her favorite Luhrmann film is Romeo + Juliet.

The director was unfazed. “I am not fearful of AI,” Luhrmann told me prior to the presentation, which he gave as part of the opening of a new art installation called Saw This, Made This. Then he backpedaled a bit, clarifying that he’s not fearful of AI taking his job as a director. “I spoke to Ai-Da this morning and said, ‘Should we be concerned about AI destroying the world?’ and she said, ‘Absolutely.’” Ultimately, Luhrmann says, AI is a new technology, and how it will be used—for creative purposes or nefarious ones—depends on humans. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Pretty much every writer, director, musician, and painter is facing the AI question right now. Many answers echo Luhrmann’s. It depends on their interactions with the technology. Members of the Writers Guild of America, who are currently on strike, are concerned that studios may one day soon want AI to write scripts that human writers then fix for a lower fee. Frank Ocean fans are reportedly getting scammed into paying for machine-generated songs. Visual artists claim AI models are unfairly being trained on their work. This week, author Stephen Marche released a novella he wrote with considerable help from large language model (LLM) tools ChatGPT, Sudowrite, and Cohere. 

The outcome of these conflicts over AI use in pop culture will have ramifications for decades to come. That’s why the arguments are so heated. Tech has been evolving and, forgive me, disrupting things for long enough now that people know the signs. Without some shared laws, beliefs, and ethics to govern the ways AI can be used, it could run rampant. Without the guidelines currently employed by the US Copyright Office stipulating that copyrightable works must have human authorship, without rules about what jobs AI can do, chaos reigns. 

Ironically, chaos is what Luhrmann notes that humans can handle and AI can’t. “Artists, to a person, are generally self-medicating flaws and chaos within them,” he says. “The thing AI just doesn’t have at the center of it is random chaos. Emotion.” I note the sign seen on the WGA picket line that said “ChatGPT doesn’t have childhood trauma.” The director agrees. “There’s understandable fear,” he says, “because when you get this massive change, there’s going to be things caught in the crossfire.” 

That doesn’t mean he thinks AI can replace human creativity, at least not presently. Which brings us back to Elvis Presley. There are people who change their appearance, their bodies, their mannerisms in order to perform as the King of Rock ’n Roll. They’re called impersonators. In his Elvis movie, Luhrmann says, “Austin Butler did not do an impersonation. What he did was Austin Butler’s interpretation of the soul of Elvis Presley. An AI can impersonate, it can’t interpret.” As we’re parting, I ask him what he’d like to do, as a filmmaker, with AI. Turns out he has already incorporated it into his work—it was the tech he used to fade Butler’s face into Presley’s. ",https://www.wired.com/story/baz-luhrmann-interview-artificial-intelligence-hollywood/,,,,,,,,
5/12/2023 9:00,BlackBerry Is a Movie That Portrays Tech Dreams Honestly—Finally,"IT’S QUAINT, LOOKING back on it now, but in the decade before iPhones, Androids, and Samsung Galaxies, BlackBerry was the smartphone. It was dubbed the “CrackBerry,” because of the seemingly addictive hold the sleek gizmo, with its satisfyingly clicky keyboard buttons, had on the market. Kim Kardashian was glued to hers. Barack Obama ran the free world from his. And its famously secure messaging client helped international drug rings conduct businesses across the globe.

ANGELA WATERCUTTER

Now, it’s a relic. An also-ran. Or, as one character puts it in BlackBerry, a new movie about the early smartphone empire’s rise and fall, it’s merely “the thing people used before they used the iPhone.” But as this fresh, thoughtful comedy makes plain, BlackBerry is more than just a bleak cautionary tale. It’s a story of how tech culture, as we know it today, took root, bloomed, and died on the vine.

The movie opens with a telling title card: “The following fictionalization is inspired by real people and real events that took place in Waterloo, Ontario.” Matt Johnson, the film’s director and cowriter, shrugs it off as “a prefix designed by our lawyers.” But beyond ensuring artistic license, it also situates the film, squarely, in a sleepy town about an hour and half from Toronto. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Before the super successful BlackBerry and its parent company, Research in Motion, revamped the region as an aspiring tech hub, Waterloo and its environs were better known for their lively farmer’s market culture and Mennonites in horse-drawn buggies.

What BlackBerry captures is the period that disrupted that, a short-lived rumpsringa in the late '90s and early aughts when the future of tech and telecommunications felt truly global. It was a period when anywhere could be the next Silicon Valley. In this sense, the titular gadget—which promised palm-of-your-hand connectivity across the globe—is, quite literally, a structuring device.

LOOSELY BASED ON the 2016 book Losing the Signal, BlackBerry seems at first blush like a familiar, Social Network-style drama of a company’s explosive rise. Nebbish engineer Mike Lazaridis (This Is the End’s Jay Baruchel) teams up with Jim Balsillie (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s Glenn Howerton), a menacing Harvard MBA. It’s a marriage of mutual convenience, undergirded by a more Faustian logic.

With Lazaridis’ ability to exploit existing wireless infrastructure, and Balsillie’s command of boardroom politics, the pair invent, and cannily market, the modern smartphone. In one funny montage, Howerton’s Balsillie recasts his sales force (“Dead-eyed dumb fucks,” as he calls them) as actors, dispatching them to fancy restaurants and private clubs to talk loudly on their BlackBerrys, in an effort to call attention to the device. “It’s not a cell phone,” he insists. “It’s a status symbol.” 

Where Balsillie is eager to exploit the device’s appeal to a class of go-go C-suite dicks—and backdate employment contracts, and play cat-and-mouse with the SEC, and generally overpromise and underdeliver—Lazaridis is more preoccupied with the nuts-and-bolts of obsessively engineering a worthwhile product. His motto: “‘Good enough’ is the enemy of humanity.” For Baruchel (who, with great reluctance, relinquished his own vintage BlackBerry just two years ago), the film is a parable, warning about what happens “when you get so big that you’re beholden to other masters.” 

“It’s no coincidence that the guys who invented the first tele-communicator were all Star Trek fanatics.”

FILMMAKER MATT JOHNSON

If Balsillie (“Ballsley, not Ball-silly,” he seethes) is the corporate devil on Lazaridis’ shoulder, the better, or at least geekier, angels of his nature are represented by longtime friend and cofounder, Doug Fregin. As imagined (and played by) Johnson, Doug is a hyperactive goober in wide, windshield eyeglasses and a David Foster Wallace headband. He compares Wi-Fi signals to the Force in Star Wars, pays for business lunches with cash pried out of a velcro Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles wallet, and uses “Glengarry Glen Ross” as a verb.

For Johnson, pop culture is a kind of lingua franca. His cult web series turned Viceland sitcom Nirvanna the Band the Show, is riven with references and extended homages: to the Criterion Collection, Nintendo’s Wii Shop Wednesday, the rollerblading sequence set to a Prodigy track in the 1995 film Hackers. But more than a pop encyclopedia, Johnson is also a deft prober of the nerd pathology. In his feature debut, 2013’s The Dirties, he plays an alienated high schooler avenging himself on his bullies by plotting a school shooting, under the auspice of making a student film about a school shooting. “School shooting comedy” is a tough sell. But Johnson committed to the premise with verve, humor, and considerable intelligence, revealing how certain dorky defense mechanisms (from pop culture obsessiveness to irony) can curdle into out-and-out psychopathy. ",https://www.wired.com/story/blackberry-movie-review/,,,,,,,,

The Best Pixel for Most People

Google Pixel 7A
$499 AT AMAZON

The Pixel 7A (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sets a new standard for mid-range smartphones. It's a little pricier than last year's Pixel 6A but packed with nearly every top-end feature you could want. This iteration includes wireless charging, which is really uncommon for phones under $500. You also get a 90-Hz screen refresh rate, which makes the onscreen interactions look and feel more fluid as there are more frames per second than before. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Its design and build quality are similar to its predecessor, though Google claims the aluminum mid-frame is slightly more durable. There's still Gorilla Glass 3 on the front screen, which isn't as scratch-resistant as some of the glass on pricier Pixels, but at least the rear is a plastic composite that feels luxe and won't crack. This model comes in Charcoal, Sea, and Snow, but there's a Google Store–exclusive Coral that has my eye.  

You won't run into any problems with performance. It's powered by Google's Tensor G2 chipset, which is the same one that's inside the Pixel 7 Pro. It's plenty fast for everyday tasks and most mobile gaming, and it also allows for a few new software tricks, like Photo Unblur, which can use machine learning algorithms to unblur people's faces in those late-night pics.

5/12/2023 8:00,BlueSky Ain’t It,"“DON’T FORGET TO turn ‘Nazis’ off in your preferences!” a friend told me when I asked for advice about Bluesky Social, the latest fad in Twitter clones. She was referring to its series of toggles for personalized moderation. You can “hide,” “warn” about, or “show” various categories of posts, like “Spam,” three different classes of sexual imagery, and, as my friend alluded to, “Hate Groups.” It’s the first sign that this is not old-fashioned, pre-Musk Twitter. Whether that’s good or bad depends on what you valued most about that era. Don’t tell that to some of the site’s biggest boosters, however.

“[J]ack selling twitter for $44b and then starting the same website and poaching all its users is so fucking funny to me like literally lmao,” reads a representative tweet on the matter. And it is indeed funny. Except it’s not the same website. Its decentralized design as a “protocol” rather than a “platform” has much more in common with Mastodon, which briefly absorbed a Twitter exodus before becoming an object of derision for what many saw as its excessive complexity and stuffy culture.

For the moment, Bluesky is easier to use, and its median culture is infinitely more freewheeling, at least on the surface. In a major coup, it attracted veteran posters like US representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and the civic god of Twitter known as dril, as well as a gaggle of shitposters. But while that has set a tone for the site that feels liberating and free of the prejudice Elon Musk has unleashed, it is far from clear that this platform will become the next Twitter; if the developers have their way, it won’t.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

TO GET TO the heart of the problem, we have to talk about why so many journalists are excited about the shitposter migration, starting with what shitposting actually is. It’s a classic I-know-it-when-I-see-it phenomenon, but in brief it can be defined as satirical content that is of ""aggressively, ironically, and trollishly poor quality."" Though Merriam-Webster puts the term’s origins in the early 90’s, it was popularized in its current form by 4chan in the aughts and has since come to be a catchall term for posts that evince a kind of Dadaist refusal to take an unserious world seriously. At least, at its best. It can also just describe a lot of casual bigotry, mocking harassment, or ceaseless ironizing that foments cynical complacency. But commentators are not wrong to suggest that the presence of such posters is part of a vibrant (if not necessarily healthy) ecosystem on a large, centralized platform.

Not everyone is happy about the shitposter influx. Conservative commentator David Frum lamented that he only wanted to meet “smart/interesting/amusing” people and did not want “weirdos” and “psychopaths” popping up on his feed, referring to the shitposters being praised in a TechCrunch article he was quote-tweeting. 

NBC tech journalist Ben Collins replied: “You do want weirdos. They’re the line of defense against the people who ruin everything. It’s why the big places—like TikTok and YouTube and Reddit and here previously—worked. They’re an enforcement mechanism that allows for better conversations and shoos away hate.”

This brings me back to Bluesky’s aspirations. The moderation toggles are just the start. A key goal of Bluesky Social is that it be decentralized—people linked across independently owned servers that use the AT Protocol protocol, with the Bluesky UI/UX overlaying it all. Crucially, users and servers will be able to label posts or specific users—e.g., with a tag like “racist”—and anyone can subscribe to that list of labels, blocking posts on that basis. Bluesky calls this “composable moderation.”",https://www.wired.com/story/bluesky-twitter-social-media/,,,,,,,,
5/12/2023 7:00,Ben Affleck Has a Plan for a Fairer Streaming World,"A meme. A WAG. A Dunkin’ shill. Now 50, Ben Affleck has become a lot of things to a lot of people.

With Air, his feel-good account of Nike’s wooing of a young Michael Jordan, out this week on Prime Video, it’s worth remembering that Affleck is also a filmmaker with a sneakily great shooting percentage. He’s won two Oscars: one for Best Screenplay for Good Will Hunting, which he shared with Matt Damon, and one for Best Picture for Argo, which he also directed and starred in. (And which, ahem, was based on a WIRED story.)

PIPE DREAM

And with his new production company, Artists Equity, Affleck is something else too: a self-styled challenger to Hollywood capitalism. At Artists Equity, it’s not just the producers of a movie but also the cast and crew who get points on the package through profit sharing. If the movie does well, everyone does well.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

It’s a bold vision, one that seems even more urgent with the Writers Guild of America on strike over things like the residuals paid by studios and streaming services. In a recent interview, Affleck spoke to WIRED about his plans.

WIRED: How did the idea behind Artists Equity first come to you?

Ben Affleck: It came to mind, slowly, through my experience producing and directing movies and looking at how the resources were spent. Also recognizing that the evolution of streaming services was putting a cap on people's abilities to benefit in the long term on an annuity basis.

Say more about that. There’s been a lot of talk recently about residuals shrinking as streamers got bigger, but you were also able to produce Air with Amazon Studios.

One of my fondest memories is of discovering a $400 residual check in the mailbox when I was on the verge of bankruptcy—if you can call it that when you don’t own anything. If you're an actor and you did a week on a TV show that was very successful, you would expect to be able to make some [annuity] money because of the success of the collective effort. Now, that’s not the case. So I constructed this model.

Obviously now with the WGA strike, there’s a feeling in Hollywood that things have to change.

The work stoppage is the same effort by other means—to fairly compensate people and to adjust the market for the reality of streaming. I don’t pretend to speak for the WGA. They're better at messaging what their goals are. But it’s no secret that the streaming model has capped a lot of the historic gains made by labor in terms of residuals, in terms of actually making the work more equitable, in terms of pay.

People forget that residuals are what pay the artists’ bills in between gigs.

Historically, if you’re an actor or a writer, those annuities were really meaningful to keep people stable. There’s no tenure. The phone stops ringing for everybody sometimes. It’s fickle. It’s capricious. It’s not just the high end of the very few who manage to become extremely successful. It’s the workaday artists who show up and make it happen.",https://www.wired.com/story/ben-affleck-interview-air-amazon/,,,,,,,,
,A Low-Tech Money-Saving Hack Is Thriving on TikTok,"IN AN OLD INTERVIEW with the actors Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman, Hackman shares a memory from one visit he made to Hoffman’s tiny apartment in Pasadena well before either of them had made any real money. As Hackman tells it, Hoffman kept mason jars full of cash in his kitchen, with each one labeled for a different part of his budget. “One says ‘rent,’ one says ‘entertainment,’ one says ‘books’ … about five of them,” says Hackman. “They all had money in them except for the one that said ‘food.’ He said, ‘Hey, can I borrow some money?’ I said, ‘You don’t need any money! You’ve got money!’ He said, ‘I can’t take the money out of the other jars.’”

The two laughed, joking that it was probably Hoffman’s mom who taught him the mason jar banking method. And, really, it probably was. For anyone over the age of 40, this tale likely evokes stories you’ve heard in your own family: great aunts with cash strapped to the bottom of the dining-room table, grandparents who cut a small hole in the mattress to store savings, maybe even your mother who kept envelopes of cash in the kitchen drawer to track her monthly spending. The idea behind the method is that when the cash is gone, it’s gone, and you're done spending. If you’re able to see in real time where your money is going, you’re better able to pay down debt and, ultimately, save.

The concept is age-old, incredibly simple, and outrageously low-tech. And right now it’s having a moment in our TikTok-obsessed, fintech-leaning culture where, one Pew Research Trust study shows, younger generations are less inclined to use cash. Hoffman’s approach has historically been called the envelope method, though today the term being tossed around social media is “cash stuffing.”

Instructional videos explaining this method are popping up on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. They typically show a set of beautifully manicured hands moving cash from a withdrawal envelope or a wallet into a cash-stuffing binder (a series of envelopes or an accordion envelope), with each section labeled for a line item in the budget: rent/mortgage, food, utilities, car, insurance, entertainment, travel, and so on.

There are also lessons on savings challenges for distinct periods of time or specific amounts of money. In the 52-week challenge, the videos teach you how to allocate an increasing number of dollars per week for savings over the course of one year. Other videos provide instruction on building a rainy-day fund or a six-month kitty to cover your expenses should you lose your job. And there’s carefully choreographed swag too. The binders, envelopes, piggy banks, wallets, and other gear are often different colors or feature various themes such as illustrations, emoji, or phrases written in artsy fonts. 

One TikTok account, @baddiesandbudgets, has more than 650,000 followers and has spawned a legitimate business aimed at helping others organize their finances and peddling some of the cash stuffing gear she uses in her videos: piggy banks, envelope binders, budgeting templates. Jasmine Taylor, the Amarillo, Texas, woman behind Baddies and Budgets, says the company has four employees including herself and is on track to pull in $1 million by year-end. A quick scroll through Instagram garners tens of thousands of posts with a cash stuffing hashtag, while Taylor has landed on CNBC, USA Today, The New York Post, and Black Enterprise to discuss it.

Our newsfeeds are often awash in old ideas dressed up as modern-day memes. But that an idea so truly unoriginal and simplistic is carrying so much heft in an economic culture that’s become increasingly complicated and reliant on technology is fascinating.

5/12/2023 7:00,Why Suicide Rates Are Dropping Around the World,"IN POST-WORLD WAR II Britain, national records began to reveal a concerning trend. Deaths by suicide were rising in the war-battered nation, an increase that would continue from the end of the war into the early 1960s. Then, in 1963, that trend mysteriously reversed. The graphs began to teeter downward. Experts puzzled over the reasons behind this drop in the suicide rate. Was it the birth of the Samaritans counseling services in 1953? Was it better psychiatric services offered under the National Health Service? But the reality turned out to be something entirely unexpected.

In the early 20th century, domestic gas that was used to warm British homes and cook people’s dinners was made almost entirely by heating coal, which created a gas mixture imbued with a hefty dose of carbon monoxide. Consequently, ingestion of carbon monoxide poisoning from a gas oven became the most common method of suicide. In the early 1950s, new and cheaper methods of gas production were brought in—with a carbon monoxide content hovering near zero.

Suicides by domestic gas poisoning in the UK began to fall rapidly, bringing down the national suicide rate. Between 1963 and 1970, deaths by suicide fell by a quarter. By 1975, suicides by gas poisoning had pretty much disappeared. The experts were not quite sure what to make of this; could it really be that simple? A 1976 paper on the topic pondered how “the removal of a single agent of self-destruction can have had such far-reaching consequences.”

FEATURED VIDEO

 

This question gets to the heart of what’s called “means restriction”—reducing access to methods people use to take their lives. Across the world, means restriction has had a huge impact. Over the past three decades, suicide rates have slowly and steadily dropped; between 2000 and 2016, the global mortality rate from suicide dropped by about 33 percent. So while it may feel like the world is crumbling into a war-torn, authoritarian shit show ravaged by rising temperatures and politicians who stand idly by, we can take solace in knowing that we’ve become better at preventing suicides.

It’s worth noting that all suicide numbers should be taken with a hefty grain of salt. Many countries underreport suicide deaths—due to data lags, as well as reasons related to stigma and religion. In some countries, suicide is still illegal. Nevertheless, it’s worth looking at the downward trend to see what lessons it can impart.

A big chunk of that decrease can be attributed to suicide declines in the two most populous countries in the world. Between 1990 and 2016, suicide rates decreased by 15 percent in India and by over 60 percent in China. A fast-growing Chinese economy resulted in far more people moving from the countryside to more urban areas. This meant that, in addition to more economic stability, they had reduced access to pesticides, a common means of suicide in lower-income countries, especially among young women in rural areas.

Banning or limiting access to dangerous pesticides has had astonishing effects in many other Asian countries too. In 1995, Sri Lanka had the highest suicide rate in the world. The same year, it banned dangerous pesticides, and the national suicide rate has since fallen by 70 percent. In Bangladesh, a similar ban led to a 65 percent reduction. Elsewhere, means restriction methods such as barriers on high structures, gun control laws, and smaller medication packet sizes have been shown to considerably reduce suicide rates.",https://www.wired.com/story/suicide-prevention-falling-rates/,,,,,,,,

Breath of the Wild Changed the Way I Play Video Games

SWAPNA KRISHNA

I haven’t been a particularly proficient builder. I attached a rocket to a tree trunk, thinking I could magic-carpet myself across the map; I flew off the back immediately. I created what I thought was a sort of “air raft,” trunks with fans on every conceivable corner to hover me away; it was as effective as a handful of helium balloons. My most successful creation in the dozen or so hours I’ve logged so far has been a comforting Big Bridge—a series of planks I continuously added to, snapped together to create a gigantic overpass capable of covering gaps or water, and occasionally creating a very impractical ramp. I dragged it with me everywhere I could, like a toddler with a splinter-filled blankie.

Since the very first Legend of Zelda, released in 1986, Nintendo has masterfully crafted worlds filled with discovery and puzzles. Its stories (typically) go something like this: A young hero named Link, aided by the princess Zelda, must stop the evil Ganon/dorf from taking over the land of Hyrule. As a cornerstone franchise, each new game is a massive undertaking for Nintendo, and a strong contender at any time for game of the year. But it’s hard to keep any franchise fresh after more than three decades, and some fans began to lose interest in yet another quest to explore temples—the series’ longstanding term for dungeons—and chase Ganondorf off again with a big special sword.

THE PREDECESSOR TO Tears of the Kingdom, 2017’s mega hit Breath of the Wild, changed that. It broke a decades-old mold by giving players true open-world freedom. Where past games kept you on a strict, predetermined path, Breath of the Wild transformed players into latchkey kids: Do what you want, just stay out of trouble. 

It was the player’s individual journey that made the game so special, whether it was how they chose to explore Hyrule’s vast new land or whatever incredibly stupid, silly pickle they got themselves into. A few days after the game’s release one player tweeted, “I accidentally set a bear on fire and accidentally mounted it and now I'm trying to stay calm as I set the forest on fire with the bear help.” 

Under my control, Link, Hyrule’s legendary hero reincarnated across generations to save the world, is a blundering idiot.

With Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo isn’t trying to revamp the entire series. It’s iterating on its creation in Breath of the Wild, adding new features and abilities to explore a familiar world with a new mission. Both director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and producer Eiji Aonuma felt—and still feel—that there was potential they’d yet to tap. That meant adding new ways to play the game, rather than creating something entirely new to run wild in. 

This is achieved, in large part, thanks to Link’s new Ultrahand and Fuse abilities. Ultrahand allows players to pick up objects and stick them together, while Fuse lets them pull inventory to craft things like homing arrows or swords with pots on them for some reason. The game allows all manner of ingenious or boneheaded options indiscriminately. And while there’s nothing more satisfying than a clever combination, players (like me) could also stand to learn from what they get wrong.",https://www.wired.com/story/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-fujibayashi-aonuma-interview/,,,,,,,,

Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult shine in this witty, fast-paced, comedic retelling (but not really) of Catherine the Great’s rise to power. Created by Tony McNamara, who earned an Oscar nomination for cowriting The Favourite, The Great offers the same combination of lush costumes and scenery mixed with a biting commentary on the world, and a woman’s place in it. A story that rings as true today as it did in the 18th century, when Catherine the Great became empress of Russia and brought about an Age of Enlightenment, this show, currently in its third season, chips away at notions of class, propriety, and monarchal rule in a way few other similar series do. If it’s historical accuracy you’re after, look elsewhere; the series’ creators describe it as decidedly “anti-historical” (which is part of the fun).

Between the dual role for Galifianakis and Anderson as the mom, it may sound like a cheap bit of stunt casting that can’t sustain more than an episode, let alone multiple character arcs. But if you’re a fan of absurdist comedy, Baskets truly ranks up there among the best of them. And Anderson, who won his first and only Emmy for his role as Costco-loving Christine, is absolutely transcendent.

Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) is a superstar of the fine dining world who has returned to his hometown of Chicago in order to save his family’s struggling sandwich shop following the death by suicide of his brother. While Carmy initially struggles to acclimate himself to being home and to his inherited restaurant’s back-to-basics style, he eventually realizes that it’s not too late to change both himself and the restaurant. Anyone who has ever worked in a busy kitchen knows the stress that comes with that, and The Bear does an excellent job of making the feeling palpable. While the plot sounds simple enough, much of Carmy’s previous life is a bit of a mystery, and it’s doled out in amuse-bouche-sized bits throughout the season, adding another layer of tension to the series.

The most valuable women are those who are fertile, as infertility has become an epidemic, and they are kept as handmaids who are forced to take part in sexual rituals with high-ranking couples in order to bear their children.

5/11/2023 13:01,Your Dog Is a Secret Weapon in the Fight Against Cancer,"JELLYBEAN CONTINUES TO defy expectations. The 5-year-old Labrador retriever mix jumps up and down from her favorite spot on the couch and walks around the living room with such ease, it’s as if she hadn’t ever had metastatic cancer. Her owners, Patricia and Zach Mendonca, still can’t quite believe the miracle. “She’s got a little bit more of a tug to her step,” Patricia says.

Jellybean was diagnosed with bone cancer in her hind leg almost three years ago. Despite amputation and chemotherapy, the cancerous cells quickly spread through her blood to her lungs, as they do in 90 percent of cases in dogs. Survival time at this stage averages two months. “We didn’t have any hopes of curing her,” says Patricia. “We were pretty devastated.”

So in November 2020, the Mendoncas enrolled Jellybean in a clinical trial at Tufts University, about an hour’s drive from their home in Rhode Island in the US. Jellybean was given a trio of pills, at no cost, which the Mendoncas stuffed daily into her favorite chicken-flavored treats. By Christmas, Jellybean’s tumors had begun to shrink, and they haven’t come back since. The response surprised even the vets treating Jellybean, and raised hopes that these drugs could help not just other dogs, but humans too.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Jellybean’s bone cancer, osteosarcoma, also affects people—particularly children and teens. Fortunately, it’s relatively rare: Some 26,000 new cases are diagnosed worldwide each year. The problem is that there haven’t been any new treatments for over 35 years, says veterinary oncologist Amy LeBlanc, and those available aren’t very effective. Osteosarcoma patients have a survival rate of only around 30 percent if cancerous cells spread to other parts of the body.

Canine studies, like Jellybean’s trial, could change all this. Cancers that arise in pet dogs are molecularly and microscopically similar to cancers in people—in the case of osteosarcoma, the similarities are striking. When compared under the microscope, a canine tissue sample and a human tissue sample of a tumor are indistinguishable. But while it’s thankfully rare in humans, osteosarcoma is at least 10 times as common in dogs—meaning there are huge numbers of canine cancer patients out there to help with research and drug testing. “The families and dogs that participate are an important piece of the puzzle in moving this research forward,” says Cheryl London, the veterinary oncologist at Tufts University’s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine who is treating Jellybean.

Importantly, dogs are not subject to the same federal regulations that limit treatment options for humans; veterinarians are much freer to use existing drugs off-label against diseases for which there aren’t currently good treatments. All told, this makes for quicker and cheaper clinical trials.

Such trials are part of the Cancer Moonshot initiative that US president Joe Biden relaunched last year and for which he has asked Congress to provide an additional $2.8 billion in the 2024 budget. “They're designed to fill a knowledge gap that is not sufficiently filled by traditional studies in mice or by data that cannot yet be easily gathered in humans,” says LeBlanc, who directs the Comparative Oncology Program at the US National Cancer Institute. The program oversees clinical trials on dogs with cancer, which are carried out by Tufts and 21 other veterinary universities in the US and Canada.",https://www.wired.com/story/dog-cancer-treatments/,,,,,,,,

Anyone with even a cursory interest in Zelda could recite these facts in their sleep, but stating them plainly hammers home a simple truth: There was not a snowball’s chance on Death Mountain that Nintendo would reinvent the series a second time. Duly, Breath’s followup, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, out tomorrow, is very much a sequel. It is not that the game takes no risks—there are mechanics here that could have proven disastrous handled by a lesser developer. There’s also no truth in the slander that Nintendo has been complacent since Breath’s release in 2017. But the TL;DR is that Nintendo has switched from revolution to evolution. Tears of the Kingdom takes the company's new-era Zelda formula and runs rampant, fulfilling many of the promises that Breath of the Wild made and broke.

It is impossible with a piece of art of this size and potentiality to say anything completely definitive, but after nearly 50 hours of gameplay, I can say this: Tears of the Kingdom is not as viscerally astonishing as Breath of the Wild, but it refines the first game’s systems to the point that they now feel antiquated.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

TEARS’ story begins several years after Zelda and Link obliterated the blue pig-god Ganon. The duo are exploring a rocky network of tunnels deep beneath Hyrule Castle. There, they use torchlight to peruse hieroglyphs depicting a great alliance between Hylians and Zonai—the ancient civilization cryptically referenced in Breath—against a monstrous man known only as the demon king. (Guess who?!)

Tears of the Kingdom is not as viscerally astonishing as Breath of the Wild, but it refines the first game’s systems to the point that they now feel antiquated.

Sinking deeper into the cave and into legend, they disturb a skeleton with long red hair, one much livelier than typical skeletons. After a cataclysm, Hyrule Castle explodes skyward, and Link, inevitably, loses Zelda and all but three of his 20 hearts. He wakes to find that someone has performed some ramshackle surgery, replacing his hand with a black claw, and that he is high high up, among stone islands speckling the sky.

Whereas Breath offers players the surface of the world to play in, Tears adds the sky. At the end of the training island, the clouds clear and Link leaps and soars: You can truly skydive (and fall) anywhere. Like previous Zelda games, the influence of filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki runs deep, this time his love of flight. In the previous game, players climbed the map towers. Now they bungee to the heavens, Link scanning the area for landmarks with his ancient Nintendo Switch (we mean Sheikah Slate, obviously).

LINK’S DESCENT DOES not stop with the ground. Across Hyrule, pits have belched out of the earth, oozing pink and black sludge, known as Gloom.

5/11/2023 12:00,The Boring Future of Generative AI,"THIS WEEK, AT its annual I/O developer conference in Mountain View, Google showcased a head-spinning number of projects and products powered by or enhanced by AI. They included a new-and-improved version of its chatbot Bard, tools to help you write emails and documents or manipulate images, devices with AI baked in, and a chatbot-like experimental version of Google search. For a full recap of the event, complete with insightful and witty commentary from my WIRED colleagues, check out our Google I/O liveblog. 

Google’s big pivot is, of course, largely fueled not by algorithms but by generative AI FOMO.

This is an edition of WIRED's Fast Forward newsletter, a weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring AI advances and other technology set to change our lives.

The appearance last November of ChatGPT—the remarkably clever but still rather flawed chatbot from OpenAI—combined with Microsoft adding the technology to its search engine Bing a few months later, triggered something of a panic at Google. ChatGPT proved wildly popular with users, demonstrating new ways to serve up information that threatened Google’s vice grip on the search business and its reputation as the leader in AI.

The capabilities of ChatGPT and AI language algorithms like those powering it are so striking that some experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering researcher who recently left Google, have felt compelled to warn that we might be building systems that we will someday struggle to control. OpenAI’s chatbot is often astonishingly good at generating coherent text on a given subject, summarizing information from the web, and even answering extremely tricky questions that require expert knowledge.

And yet, unfettered AI language models are also silver-tongued agents of chaos. They will gladly fabricate facts, express unpleasant biases, and say unpleasant or disturbing things with the right prompting. Microsoft was forced to limit the capabilities of Bing chat shortly after launch to avoid such embarrassing misbehavior, in part because its bot divulged its secret codename—Sydney—and accused a New York Times columnist of not loving his spouse.

Google worked hard to tone down the chaotic streak of text-generation technology as it prepared the experimental search feature announced yesterday that responds to search queries with chat-style answers synthesizing information from across the web.

Google’s smarter version of search is impressively narrow-minded, refusing to use the first person or talk about its thoughts or feelings. It completely avoids topics that might be considered risky, refusing to dispense medical advice or offer answers on potentially controversial topics such as US politics.

Google deserves recognition for reining in generative chatbots’ wild side like that. But in my tests, the new search interface felt incredibly tame compared to ChatGPT or Google’s own chatbot Bard.

As the company moves the technology into more of its products, perhaps the generative AI revolution will turn out to be a lot less fun than you might expect from the early shock and awe of ChatGPT, a chatbot that has an edgy charm. Gone are the wild ravings and imaginings of powerful AI bots. In their place are new ways to populate spreadsheets, compose email pleasantries, and find products to buy.

Even if “AI doomers” warning about errant AI prove overblown, it will be interesting to watch how companies like Google and OpenAI balance the development of more powerful generative language models with the need to have them behave.

Google has invested huge sums and major resources in AI over recent years, with CEO Sundar Pichai often pitching the company as “AI first”, and the company is desperate to show it can advance the technology more quickly than OpenAI. One high-level message from Google’s stream of AI announcements was that the company is not going to hold back anymore, as it did the LaMDA chatbot that was announced long before ChatGPT appeared but not made public.

In March, some big names in AI research signed an open letter calling for a six-month pause on creating machine learning systems more powerful than GPT-4, which powers ChatGPT. Pichai was not a signatory and said in his keynote speech yesterday that the company is currently training a new, more powerful language model called Gemini.

A source at Google tells me this new system will incorporate a range of recent advances from different large language models and may eclipse GPT-4. But don’t expect to get to experience the full power or charisma Gemini can offer. If Google applies the same chaos-taming methods seen in its chat-like search experiment, it may just seem like another surprisingly clever autocomplete.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-boring-future-of-generative-ai/,,,,,,,,
5/11/2023 11:08,Spotify Has an AI Music Problem—but Bots Love It,"IF A SONG is created by artificial intelligence and listened to by a bot, was it even heard at all? It’s a problem music-streaming companies now face as generative AI is rapidly making it easier for anyone to churn out songs with a few clicks, and then send bots to stream them for cash.

How the Streaming Era Turned Music Into Sludge

MORGAN MEAKER

""It's a floodgate,"" says Tony Rigg, a lecturer in music industry management at the University of Central Lancashire in the UK. He's talking about the arrival of AI-generated music. And that torrent of new music amplifies the issue of fake listening, giving people a simple way to get streams on low-quality tracks. 

Artificial streaming, or bot listening, isn’t new. Some turn to third-party companies promising to boost streams, which then enlist bot-made accounts to listen to the same playlists on repeat. It’s a problem because streaming companies divide up royalty payments from a limited pool of cash—the more a song plays, the more its creator earns. So, more money for songs listened to by bots can mean that less is sent to those with human fans. Human artists have already been caught up in artificial streaming scandals, but AI is adding a new element. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

The first major test case came last week when Spotify reportedly removed tens of thousands of songs created and uploaded to Spotify by AI music generator Boomy. These made up a small percentage of total Boomy creations, but did include songs that were suspected of being streamed by bots, according to the Financial Times. Spotify did not respond to a request for comment to confirm the removal, but the platform does have policies against fake streaming.

Boomy uploads to Spotify were paused last week, but resumed May 6. Alex Mitchell, Boomy’s CEO and founder, says that the company is “categorically against any type of manipulation or artificial streaming.” Mitchell also says Boomy has a system in place to respond to suspicious streaming notices sent by streaming companies, and can move to freeze payments and block users who may be manipulating the system for gain. But tons of artificial listeners were still able to get through before they were caught, showing just how prolific these scams have become.

FAKE STREAMING IS an industry-wide problem that goes beyond AI-made music. A study from France’s Centre National de la Musique, a public-private organization focused on the French music industry, found that between 1 and 3 percent of all music streamed across various popular platforms in France in 2021 was detected to have been streamed by bots, accounting for an estimated 1 to 3 billion fake streams. 

Competition for listeners is fierce. There are more than 100 million songs on Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Spotify, and many are rarely, if ever, played. With rapid advancements in generative AI, a deluge of new songs are expected to hit streaming platforms.

And, as with so much in generative AI, it’s happening fast. Last month, a song faking the voices of Drake and The Weeknd went viral, and was booted from Spotify. As the technology becomes more convincing, the impersonations are duping more and more people. Scammers allegedly used AI to generate new tracks with Frank Ocean’s voice, and sold them to fans for thousands of dollars, luring people with a promise of leaked songs. ",https://www.wired.com/story/spotify-ai-music-robot-listeners/,,,,,,,,
5/11/2023 10:56,Asus’ New Handheld Can Run Your PC Games (for an Hour or Two),"EVER SINCE THE Nintendo Switch arrived in 2017, it's been plausible to dream about carrying your entire gaming library with you. Valve’s Steam Deck comes the closest—after a buggy start, it’s become a surprisingly impressive piece of hardware. Now Asus hopes to dethrone it with the ROG Ally, a Windows-based device that promises to bring every PC game to a handheld.

It’s a bold promise, and one I was excited to see in action. I had been skeptical of the Steam Deck, but I wanted to believe, and that open-mindedness paid off. Unfortunately, after using the ROG Ally, I’m not convinced that Asus can compete with Valve’s handheld, much less Nintendo's. Basically, the ROG Ally is for those willing to sacrifice a lot of usability to play Fallout: New Vegas on the toilet.

Janky and Cranky

The ROG Ally isn’t so much a Windows-based handheld gaming console as it’s just a Windows PC built inside a large controller with a screen. This is great for game compatibility and terrible for just about everything else. The very first time I tried to launch Steam from the Armoury launcher, the app crashed because I didn’t yet have an internet connection (which the device never prompted me to set up), popping up a standard, albeit tiny Windows error box.

Connecting to Wi-Fi, I found a UI problem that gave me a bad premonition of things to come: The onscreen keyboard I needed to enter my (rather long) Wi-Fi password covered half the password box. It was also finicky and failed to register several letters. To correct those mistakes, I had to hold down the “Show password” icon while stretching my fingers to tap the onscreen arrow keys.

It sounds minor, but connecting to Wi-Fi is one of the first, most basic aspects of setting up a device, and I was already annoyed. This was a theme that popped up constantly. I felt myself struggling against the form factor of the Ally. Once, while playing Doom Eternal, I was suddenly snapped out of the game to the Windows desktop, with a large black box filling half the screen. What merited such an interruption? “Your battery is running low. You might want to plug in your PC.”

Most of the UI work is offloaded to Windows-based game stores, and of those only Steam is really prepared for a handheld interface. Steam’s Big Picture mode is designed for everything from handhelds to TVs, and it's the default interface for the Steam Deck. It’s also what you’ll find when launching Steam on the Ally, but other stores like Xbox and Epic are just scaled-down versions of their desktop app.

Controlling the Chaos

When you install a game on the Steam Deck, you see a pop-up that lets you know what may or may not work in a handheld format—whether the game’s designed for a controller, text scaling, etc. The ROG Ally has none of that on its own. Steam will sometimes pick a controller profile for you, but when downloading games from the major stores, you’re taking a gamble on whether it will work.",https://www.wired.com/review/asus-rog-ally/,,,,,,,,
5/11/2023 9:00,The Xiaomi Poco F5 and F5 Pro Lag Behind the Pack,"THE GAP BETWEEN mid-range and high-end smartphones has slowly been closing. Spend around $400 on a phone and you can expect a gorgeous screen, a good camera, and enough grunt to run the most demanding mobile games. The features that set the top phones apart are often far from essential.

The same holds true for Xiaomi's Poco F5 and F5 Pro. If you are looking for weaknesses, you won’t find them on the spec sheet. These phones pack in everything you need at an attractive price. But the trade-off for this impressive hardware is generic, forgettable design and messy, confusing software. Bloatware and ads lurk beneath the surface. Sure, you can push them under with a bit of work, but is it worth the effort when strong alternatives are so abundant?

Mid-Range

The Poco F5 and F5 Pro are almost exactly the same size. The F5 Pro is a touch bigger and heavier, with a curved glass back sliding into a thinner frame. It’s funny how a little extra weight gives a phone a more expensive feel. The F5 has a trio of round lenses, much like the latest phones from Samsung and Apple, but the F5 Pro has a more pronounced rectangular camera module with a metal surround, which looks a bit dated to my eyes.

Both have a USB-C port and SIM tray on the bottom edge, but only the F5 finds room for a 3.5-mm audio jack up top. They are relatively lightweight and easy to use one-handed. The F5 has a fingerprint sensor in the power button, while the F5 Pro has an in-display fingerprint sensor. Both worked swiftly and reliably for me.

While the F5 and F5 Pro boast a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 120-Hz refresh rate, the Pro has a higher resolution and is slightly more responsive. These are bright, sharp screens that are legible in sunlight, and I found them a pleasure to use for web browsing, gaming, and kicking back with Netflix. The dual speakers are loud and clear.

The F5 Pro gets a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, but the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 in the Poco F5 actually outperforms it in many benchmarks. In everyday use, I did not feel any difference. Both phones can smoothly run games like Real Racing 3 and PUBG Mobile at a high frame rate, and the Pro kept its cool during a monster session of Kingdom Rush Vengeance. Beyond the quirks of Xiaomi’s user interface, MIUI 14, I had no issues jumping in and out of apps, scrolling the web, or using the camera.

Stamina is pleasing. You can expect either phone to see you through the busiest days with some change. The F5 has a 5,000-mAh battery. The F5 Pro stretches to 5,160 mAh. I went a couple of days between charges, even with several hours of screen time each day. Both phones come with a 67-watt charger in the box, and I charged the F5 from 29 to 80 percent in just 17 minutes. Only the F5 Pro supports wireless charging, and it is relatively speedy, if you can find a wireless charger capable of delivering 30 watts. The F5 and the F5 Pro models I tested had an ample 12 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. There are other versions in some markets.",https://www.wired.com/review/xiaomi-poco-f5-and-f5-pro/,,,,,,,,
5/11/2023 7:00,A Republican-Led Lawsuit Threatens Critical US Cyber Protections,"THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S push to tighten the cybersecurity of US critical infrastructure has drawn its first major lawsuit, sparking a court battle that could weaken the federal government’s ability to protect the facilities and devices that underpin American life.

The stakes of the lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Arkansas, Iowa, and Missouri—who are seeking to invalidate a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirement for states to assess water systems’ cybersecurity practices during routine inspections—reach beyond Americans’ tap water. Other agencies are paying close attention as they craft rules for hospitals, emergency broadcast systems, and other vital infrastructure.

The EPA case highlights the vulnerability of Biden’s strategy of issuing cyber regulations without explicit congressional authorization, a weakness already evident in legal challenges to White House policies like student loan forgiveness. The lawsuit could presage new efforts by Republican-led states and business groups to undermine regulations intended to prevent hackers from sowing chaos.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

The legal morass also underscores the need for the US to settle long-running disagreements about the role of the government in safeguarding privately owned infrastructure.

“There's a debate that we're going to have to work through as a country over how much regulation is enough and whether you should be regulated at all,” says James Lewis, senior vice president and director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “In some ways, we dodged the debate, and now it's come home for us to look at.”

Sidestepping Congress, Courting Challenges

When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, his cyber policy aides were determined to move beyond what they saw as the failed approach of trusting private-sector critical infrastructure operators to protect their systems. But because the laws giving regulatory agencies their powers were written before the emergence of cyber threats, imposing rules on companies sometimes required creative strategies.

White House officials had to “look for new and innovative ways” to mandate secure practices, says Jeff Greene, who served as chief of cyber response and policy at the National Security Council (NSC) during Biden’s first year in office.

The hunt for legal authorities to regulate critical infrastructure was nothing new. Recent presidents have routinely sought to enact their agendas while skirting a gridlocked Congress. “We had an era where the response to Congress being slow was to use these executive branch workarounds,” Lewis says. “And those are being challenged across the board.”

Now, for the first time, cyber mandates are getting swept up in that pushback.

Biden officials may not have been too worried about lawsuits when crafting the EPA directive because of their experiences with previous cyber regulations. After pipeline companies objected to new Transportation Security Administration (TSA) rules, the agency worked with the industry to address its concerns and avoided a legal battle. Similar rail and aviation regulations were likewise uncontroversial.

“The fact that you haven’t seen challenges is reflective of the lengths to which the administration has gone to try to work with those sectors,” says Greene, who is now the senior director for cybersecurity programs at the Aspen Institute. “The administration really has gone out of its way to do this collaboratively.”",https://www.wired.com/story/epa-lawsuit-biden-cybersecurity-critical-infrastructure/,,,,,,,,
5/11/2023 7:00,Google Doesn’t Need You to Buy Its Folding Phone,"WHEN YOU SAW the unveiling of the Pixel Fold during the I/O keynote yesterday, you probably took a long look at the $1,800 handset and said to yourself, “Cool, but I don’t really want to spend that much money on something so weird.”

Turns out, the urge to not buy a folding phone is a common one; folding devices have captured less than 2 percent of the smartphone market and still exist firmly within a niche. But that reluctance is actually fine for Google, since the company most likely does not expect the Pixel Fold to sell in huge numbers. Instead, Google expects the device to show its designers a whole lot about how people use folding phones, and how Android must adapt to best serve this growing market of handsets with multiple screens.

Anshel Sag, an analyst at the firm Moor Insights & Strategy, points to the high price of the Pixel Fold as a marker for Google’s intentions with the device. Its going rate is about the same as something like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold4, and nearly $800 pricier than Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip4. If Google really wanted to sell more units, it might have dropped the price enough to undercut Samsung’s larger foldable, or tried to entice folks who’ve never considered a folding phone because they don’t have a couple grand to spare. Priced as it is, the Pixel Fold cannot be expected to become the next big hit. It’s instead meant to be a vessel on which Google can perfect its foldable software future.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

“They have to build hardware to be able to understand how that software will be used,” Sag says. “Most of the issues with foldables have been resolved, with the exception of software. Google needs to improve the experience and, more importantly, enable developers to make the most of foldables as a form factor.”

For comparison, consider Google’s Pixel Watch, the Android-powered wearable that was recently released into an already mature wrist computer market dominated by Apple, Samsung, and Garmin. It was years late to the starting line and emerged as a smooth and beautiful device that was nevertheless underpowered and buggy. The Pixel Watch has still sold reasonably well, though nowhere close to the competition. So why bother making it at all? Well, because there is a whole ecosystem of software for Wear OS devices that Google knows it needs to be on top of. And because it makes both the hardware and the software, Google can use the Pixel Watch to experiment with new interactions, apps, and experiences.

Building a proprietary folding device once again gives Google total control of the hardware and software for a new class of gadget. On its own foldable phone, the company can better tinker with things like multitasking, screen switching, or app behaviors specific to larger screens. The company doesn’t need to sell millions of units to learn how these things should work. It needs to sell just enough Pixel Folds to get an idea of how people are using it in the wild.",https://www.wired.com/story/google-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-pixel-fold/,,,,,,,,
5/11/2023 7:00,Self-Driving Cars Are Being Put on a Data Diet,"FOR SELF-DRIVING-CAR DEVELOPERS, like many iPhone and Google Photos users, the growing cost of storing files on the cloud has become a nagging headache.

Early on, robocar companies pursued a brute-force approach to maximize miles and data. “We could take all the data the cars have seen over time, the hundreds of thousands of pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles, [and] take from that a model of how we expect them to move,” said Chris Urmson, an early leader of Google’s self-driving project, in a 2015 TED Talk. 

Urmson spoke at a time when autonomous vehicle prototypes were relatively few and the handful of companies testing them could afford to keep almost every data point they scooped up from the road. But nearly a decade later, Google’s project and many others have fallen far behind their own predictions of the timeline for success. Growing fleets, fancier sensors, and tighter budgets are forcing companies working on robotaxi and robofreight services to get pickier about what stays on their servers. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

The newfound restraint is a sign of maturity for an industry that has begun moving people and goods without drivers in a few cities when the weather’s good and streets are relatively clear, but is yet to generate profits. Figuring out which data to keep and which to discard could be key to expanding service to more locations as companies train their technology on the nuances of new areas.

“Having tons and tons more data is valuable to some extent,” says Andrew Chatham, who oversees the computing infrastructure at the Google driverless tech spinout Waymo. “But at some point, having more interesting data is important.” Rivals including Aurora, Cruise, Motional, and TuSimple are also keeping closer watch on their data stores.

The trend could spread at a time that driverless projects are facing pressure to control spending after years of losses. Companies ranging from General Motors, which owns robotaxi service Cruise, to Waymo-owner Alphabet are in the midst of wide-ranging cost-cutting this year—including mass layoffs—as sales in core businesses slow due to a shaky economy. Meanwhile, cheap and easy funding is drying up for autonomous vehicle startups.

Naturally, all spending is under scrutiny. Amazon Web Services charges about 2 cents per gigabyte monthly for its popular S3 cloud storage service, a price that adds up quickly on data-intensive projects, and doubles in some cases when factoring in bandwidth costs to transfer data. Intel estimated in 2016 that each autonomous vehicle would generate 4,000 gigabytes of data per day, a volume that would cost about $350,000 to store for a year at Amazon’s current prices.

Chucking data might sound perverse for the tech industry. Companies like Google and Meta have long been ridiculed and even penalized for collecting everything they can—including users’ locations, clicks, and searches—with the idea that greater understanding of behavior leads to better designed services. The mantra created a culture of collecting data despite any clear application. For instance, Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged in 2019 that only “a small subset of data helps serve ads.”",https://www.wired.com/story/self-driving-cars-are-being-put-on-a-data-diet/,,,,,,,,
5/11/2023 7:00,The Surprising Synergy Between Acupuncture and AI,"I USED TO fall asleep at night with needles in my face. One needle shallowly planted in the inner corners of each eyebrow, one per temple, one in the middle of each eyebrow above the pupil, a few by my nose and mouth. I’d wake up hours later, the hair-thin, stainless steel pins having been surreptitiously removed by a parent. Sometimes they’d forget about the treatment, and in the morning we’d search my pillow for needles. My very farsighted left eye gradually became only somewhat farsighted, and my mildly nearsighted right eye eventually achieved a perfect score at the optometrist’s. By the time I was six, my glasses had disappeared from the picture albums.

The story of my recovered eyesight was the first thing I’d think to mention when people found out that my parents are specialists in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and asked me what I thought of the practice. It was a concrete and rather miraculous firsthand experience, and I knew what it meant—to begin to see the world more clearly while under my mother and father’s care.

Otherwise, I rarely knew what to say. I would recall hearing TCM mentioned in relation to “poor evidence” or “badly designed studies” and feel challenged to provide some defense for a line of work seen as illegitimate. I would feel a pull of obligation to defend Chinese medicine as a way to protect my parents, their care and toils, but also an urge to resist shouldering that obligation for the sake of someone else’s fleeting curiosity and perhaps entertainment. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Mostly, I wished I had a better understanding of TCM, even just for myself. Now that I work in machine learning (ML), I’m often struck by the parallels between this cutting-edge technology and the ancient practice of TCM. For one, I can’t quite explain either satisfactorily.

IT’S NOT THAT there aren’t explanations for how the field of Chinese medicine works. I, and many others, just find the theories dubious. According to both classical and modern theory, blood and qi—pronounced “chi,” variously interpreted to mean something like vapor—move around and regulate the body, which itself is not considered separate from the mind.

Qi flows through channels called meridians. The anatomical charts hanging on the walls of my parents’ clinics feature meridians scoring the body in neat, straight lines—from chest to finger, or from the waist to the inner thigh—overlaid on diagrams of the bones and organs. At various points along these meridians, needles can be inserted to remove blockages, improving the flow of qi. All TCM treatments ultimately revolve around qi: Acupuncture banishes unhealthy qi and circulates healthy qi from the outside; herbal medicines do so from the inside.

On my parents’ charts, the meridians and acupuncture points are depicted like a subway map and seem to float slightly upward, tethered only loosely to the recognizable shapes of intestines and joints underneath. This lack of visual correspondence is reflected in the science; little evidence has been found for the physical existence of meridians, or of qi. Studies have investigated whether meridians are special conduits for electrical signals—but these experiments were badly designed—or whether they are related to fascia, the thin stretchy tissue that surrounds almost all internal body parts. All of this work is recent, and results have been inconclusive.

In contrast, the effectiveness of acupuncture, particularly for ailments like neck disorders and low back pain, is well-supported in modern scientific journals. Insurance companies are convinced; most of my mother’s patients come to her for acupuncture because it’s covered by New Zealand’s national insurance plan.",https://www.wired.com/story/machine-learning-chinese-medicine-acupuncture-study-design/,,,,,,,,
5/11/2023 6:00,Doug Rushkoff Is Ready to Renounce the Digital Revolution,"THE MEDIA STUDIES building at Queens College is small and dark, with low ceilings and narrow corridors. It was built more than a century ago as a residential school for incorrigible boys, and a certain atmosphere of neglect remains. When I visit on a January weekday to see Douglas Rushkoff, who teaches here, he guides me around a stack of fallen ceiling tiles to his office in a back corner of the first floor. The Wi-Fi in the room is spotty, so he uses an Ethernet adapter to plug his laptop into the wall. The only evidence that we haven’t traveled back to the ’90s is that when it’s time for class, no students show up. Instead, Rushkoff opens his laptop and brings up a grid of faceless black boxes.

This is the first course meeting of “Digital Economics: Crypto, NFTs and the Blockchain.” Rushkoff is a good sport about teaching on Zoom, though it’s a shame his class of mostly undergraduates can’t fully appreciate the 62-year-old media-studies-professor look that he’s absolutely nailed: black V-neck, cropped gray hair. He launches into an impassioned half-hour lecture in which he urges his students, only three of whom have their cameras on, to see through the social construction of money—he pulls out a dollar bill and waves it in front of the laptop screen, saying, “This is not money. This is a piece of paper that we use to represent money”—and to probe what he calls the “big question” of his life’s work: how power travels across media landscapes.

Outside of this Queens College classroom, Rushkoff is a widely cited theorist of the internet, known for his prolific and influential writings on culture and economics. He gets the occasional student who recognizes his work—“He’s a famous author,” one writes on Rate My Professor, “just do a Google search”—but most of them are busy people logging in to class from their phones, more interested in fulfilling their degree requirements than in the dense collage of Rushkoff’s book covers taped to the wall behind his desk.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

That his class may not be his students’ first priority doesn’t bother Rushkoff much. He’s made a point of landing at City University of New York in Queens after a teaching stint at the far more expensive, prestige-mongering, private New York University. In a portion of his lecture, he hints at the trajectory his intellectual life has taken:

“I was pretty freaking excited in the ’90s about the possibilities for a new kind of peer-to-peer economy. What we would build that would be like a TOR network of economics, the great Napsterization of economics in a digital environment,” he tells his students. But more recently, he continues, he’s turned his attention to something else that this new digital economy has created: “It made a bunch of billionaires and a whole lot of really poor, unhappy people.”

This kind of rhetoric is part of a recent, decisive shift in direction for Rushkoff. For the past 30 years, across more than a dozen nonfiction books, innumerable articles, and various media projects about the state of society in the internet age, Rushkoff had always walked a tightrope between optimism and skepticism. He was one of the original enthusiasts of technology’s prosocial potential, charting a path through the digital landscape for those who shared his renegade, anti-government spirit. As Silicon Valley shed its cyberpunk soul and devolved into an incubator of corporate greed, he continued to advocate for his values from within. Until now. Last fall, with the publication of his latest book, Survival of the Richest: Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires, Rushkoff all but officially renounced his membership in the guild of spokespeople for the digital revolution. So what happened?

PHOTOGRAPH: CLARK HODGIN

It is, generally speaking, a difficult time to maintain a straight face as a diehard advocate of decentralization. A couple of months before I come to see Rushkoff, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, run by a cabal of tasteless pyramid schemers blathering platitudes about art and community, collapsed, torching billions of dollars in the process. These internet capitalists proved to be worse guardians of the public interest than even the corporate robber barons of yore. (Some weeks after my visit, Silicon Valley Bank failed and nearly dragged the global financial system down along with it—a direct result of the Trump administration’s deregulation agenda.)

Confronted with such irrefutable evidence, Rushkoff isn’t just lying low or changing the subject the way perennial techno-optimists often do. His conversion is deeper. “I find, a lot of times, digital technologies are really good at exacerbating the problem while also camouflaging the problem,” he tells the black boxes that represent his students. “They make things worse while making it look like something’s actually changed.” Still, as he talks, I can occasionally catch a glimpse of Rushkoff reverting into his former persona: the inveterate Gen X techno-optimist, the man who can’t resist the untested promise of ever newer tools. Near the end of class, he starts instructing his students to not use ChatGPT to write their assignments, then halts abruptly, as if unable to go on. “Well, actually,” he says, reconsidering, “we’ll figure it out.”",https://www.wired.com/story/doug-rushkoff-survival-of-the-richest/,,,,,,,,
5/11/2023 2:00,Europe’s Moral Crusader Lays Down the Law on Encryption,"ON APRIL 23, the German politician Patrick Breyer uploaded a meme to his Mastodon account. “Big Sister is Watching You”, it warned in big white letters, written behind a smiling photograph of Ylva Johansson, the EU commissioner in charge of home affairs. Within the bureaucratic confines of Brussels, it’s rare for a politician to evoke enough anger to feature on a meme—let alone be labeled as the modern incarnation of author George Orwell’s Big Brother by her colleagues.

But Johansson has become a divisive figure in Europe. The Swedish politician has positioned herself in the midst of a vitriolic debate over online child sexual abuse material (CSAM), one that pits individual privacy against the safety of vulnerable young people. The EU Home Affairs Commissioner is the architect of a deeply controversial new bill that proposes ways to force tech companies, including those with encrypted platforms, to scan their users’ private messages in an attempt to wipe both CSAM and grooming attempts off the internet. This is a personal crusade for the Swedish Johansson, a straight talker with a penchant for brightly colored blazers. Both supporters and opponents describe the commissioner as the passionate and stubborn driving force behind the bill, which she regularly describes as “my proposal.”

Arrayed against her is a fierce coalition of privacy advocates, American YouTubers, German soccer fans, and tech executives who argue that the proposal would severely impact online privacy. They call it the “chat control” bill and warn that it would open dangerous backdoors into encrypted apps. Because Johansson has made herself the face of this bill, criticism is lobbed at her personally. “Either she’s stupid or she’s evil,” says Jan Jonsson, CEO of Swedish VPN service Mullvad. In February, she was given a dubious “prize” at the Dutch Big Brother Awards, an event organized by digital rights group Bits of Freedom, which identifies heroes and villains in the fight for privacy. Johansson was firmly in the latter category, winning a public vote for the individual who has most threatened individual privacy.

The award ceremony took place on Johansson’s birthday. But she still attended—virtually, at least—and gave an acceptance speech. She says she doesn’t care about the criticism. “I think I have a moral obligation to act,” she told WIRED in March. “If I don’t, who am I? I will be a little mouse. I will be nothing.”

Child sexual abuse is not a crime that can be blamed on technology. But the internet has created a global market for its dissemination. In 2022, US charity The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) received 32 million reports of suspected online CSAM. And Europe bears some responsibility for that market. Last year, more than 60 percent of all known child sexual abuse material was being hosted on EU servers, according to British nonprofit the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF).

This is not news to tech giants. The world’s largest social media platforms already have established systems to try and root out such content. Facebook, for example, uses photo-matching technology that compares photos and videos posted to the platform against a database of known CSAM content so replicas can be automatically pulled down. The company also uses AI to detect previously unidentified CSAM content. When the AI finds it, this content is sent to the NCMEC, which over the years has evolved into a clearing house for some of the most disturbing content on the internet. Once the NCMEC receives content, its staff decides what to do next: whether to report the material to the police or try to rescue the child shown in the video.",https://www.wired.com/story/europes-moral-crusader-lays-down-the-law-on-encryption/,,,,,,,,
5/11/2023 0:11,Twitter Encrypted DMs Are Deeply Inferior to Signal and WhatsApp,"ELON MUSK'S LONG-PROMISED launch of encrypted direct messages on Twitter has arrived. Like most attempts to add end-to-end encryption to a massive existing platform—never an easy proposition—there's good, bad, and ugly. The good: Twitter has added an optional layer of security for a small subset of its users that has never existed in Twitter's 16-plus years online. As for the bad and ugly: Well, that list is quite a lot longer.

Yesterday night, Twitter announced the release of encrypted direct messages, a feature that Musk had assured users was coming from his very first days running the company. To Twitter's credit, it accompanied the new feature with an article on its help center breaking down the new feature's strengths and weaknesses with unusual transparency. And as the article points out, there are plenty of weaknesses. 

In fact, the company appears to have stopped short of calling the feature ""end-to-end"" encrypted, the term that would mean only users on the two ends of conversations can read messages, rather than hackers, government agencies that can eavesdrop on those messages, or even Twitter itself.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

""As Elon Musk said, when it comes to Direct Messages, the standard should be, if someone puts a gun to our heads, we still can’t access your messages,"" the help desk page reads. ""We’re not quite there yet, but we’re working on it.""

In fact, the description of Twitter's encrypted messaging feature that follows that initial caveat seems almost like a laundry list of the most serious flaws in every existing end-to-end encrypted messaging app, now all combined into one product—along with a few extra flaws that are all its own.

The encryption feature is opt-in, for instance, not turned on by default, a decision for which Facebook Messenger has received criticism. It explicitly doesn't prevent “man-in-the-middle” attacks that would allow Twitter to invisibly spoof users' identities and intercept messages, long considered the most serious flaw in Apple's iMessage encryption. It doesn't have the “perfect forward secrecy” feature that makes spying on users harder even after a device is temporarily compromised. It doesn't allow for group messaging or even sending photos or videos. And perhaps most seriously, it currently restricts this subpar encrypted messaging system to only the verified users messaging each other—most of whom must pay $8 a month—vastly limiting the network that might use it.

“This clearly is not better than Signal or WhatsApp or anything that uses the Signal Protocol, in terms of features, in terms of security,” says Matthew Green, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on cryptography, referring to the Signal Messenger app that's widely considered the modern standard in end-to-end encrypted calling and texting. Signal's encryption protocol is also used in both WhatsApp's encrypted-by-default communications and Facebook Messenger's opt-in encryption feature known as Secret Conversations. (Both Signal and WhatsApp are free, compared to the $8 per month for a Twitter Blue subscription that includes verification.) “You should use those things instead if you really care about security,” Green says. “And they’ll be easier because you won’t have to pay $8 a month.”",https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-encrypted-dm-signal-whatsapp/,,,,,,,,
5/10/2023 16:45,Everything Google Announced at I/O 2023,"THE OPENING KEYNOTE address of the Google I/O developer conference today was stuffed with announcements of new devices and AI-powered features coming to familiar software tools. The company leaned hard into generative computing, loudly characterizing itself as a decades-long leader in AI tech. It also gleefully put AI at the forefront of nearly every service and device it operates, including the new Pixel phones and tablet it unveiled today.

Here are all of Google’s announcements from I/O 2023.

The Pixel Fold Arrives

Google’s first folding phone, the Pixel Fold, is here and costs a startling $1,799. It’s thinner than Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold4, and there’s a wide, full front screen that offers up an almost normal smartphone experience. Open it up and you get a 7.6-inch OLED screen for watching movies, multitasking, or reading. We’ve got a hands-on report where you can read more about the Fold. Preorders are live now—if you bite, Google is tossing in a free Pixel Watch—but it ships in June. 

There’s a Pixel Tablet Too

Announced at last year’s Google I/O, the Pixel Tablet is finally a reality. Well, almost—preorders are live today (only in 11 countries), and it goes on sale June 20, so you still have to wait a bit more. This $499 tablet isn’t really meant to be a tablet you take with you on the go. Rather, it rests on a magnetic dock (included) when you’re not using it, and the dock wirelessly recharges the slate and doubles as a speaker (the sound quality is purportedly equal to a Nest Hub). When it’s on the dock, it acts as a traditional Google smart speaker, with options to control your smart home devices, and even has a similar microphone array to pick up your “Hey Google” commands. Chromecast is built in, so you can cast to it from your phone or laptop. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

When you want to use it, just pop it off the dock and it’s a normal Android tablet—except a bit better, because Google has made some strides in improving the tablet experience on Android, with more than 50 Google apps optimized for the larger screen. It’s powered by the Tensor G2 chipset, and has many of the same software features as other Pixel devices. Sadly, there are no other accessories—no stylus and no keyboard. You can take it out and use it with Bluetooth accessories, but it’s clear Google is really envisioning this as a homebody.

Also a Low-Cost Pixel 7A

Every year, Google announces an A-series version of the flagship Pixel that came before. This year’s Pixel 7A is a little more pricey ($499) than last year’s model, but you get a few more high-end perks, like a 90-Hz screen refresh rate and wireless charging support. The cameras are also completely new, with a 64-megapixel sensor leading the pack. You can read more about it in our review (8/10, WIRED Recommends). You can also order it right now—Google is tossing a free case and $100 for another accessory (like the Pixel Buds A-Series) if you buy it today.

Chatbot-Style Answers Are Coming to Search
VIDEO: GOOGLE

Google users in the US will be able to access an experimental version of the company’s web search that incorporates ChatGPT-style text generation. For some queries, AI-generated text will appear above the usual links and ads, summarizing information drawn from across the web. A query about the coronation of Britain’s new king might be met with a couple of paragraphs summarizing the event. If asked about ebikes, Google’s algorithms can list bullet-point takeaways of product reviews published by various websites. WIRED, of course, is one of those websites that publish many product reviews, so we’ll be watching to see how this feature changes the way readers encounter our buying advice.

Android Gets an AI Boost
VIDEO: GOOGLE

Google’s updates to Android—normally the focus of I/O events in the past—came some 80 minutes into the event. As you might have guessed, Google is sticking even more AI features into its mobile operating system. It laid out some enhancements to privacy protection, but mostly focused on cosmetic settings. The big setting that Google execs seemed stoked about involved AI wallpapers, which let you change the art styles of photos and create interactive, moving backgrounds from pictures and emoji.

Google is also bringing the generative features of its Bard chatbot directly into Android messaging, with settings that let you ask questions right in the chat box and adjust the syntax of your messages to adapt to different tones.

Generative AI Creation Tools in Workspace

Google is sliding AI into its Workspace apps like Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Duet AI for Workspace, as it’s called, can use Google’s generative AI to create job descriptions, write creative stories, or auto-generate spreadsheets for tracking information. It can also build out whole presentations, suggesting text for slides or instantly generating custom visual elements like photos. It appears to be Google’s answer to Microsoft’s 365 Copilot, which uses some of the company’s generative tools to add productive and creative enhancements to Microsoft’s Office software. Google’s AI-powered updates to its free web-based software suite will be available to consumers soon, the company says.

Behold the Magic Editor

An update to Google’s photo-editing feature Magic Eraser is coming later this year. The tool will now be called Magic Editor, and Google says it’s basically a quick mobile version of Photoshop. Users can change nearly every element of a photo, including adjusting lighting, removing unwanted foreground elements like backpack straps, and even moving the subject of the photo into other parts of the frame.

Google’s pitching the service as a way to enhance photos, but the potential is there to make really any edit to a photo at all. It’s not hard to imagine this going wildly off the rails, as any photo can be easily adjusted to move people around, reposition arms so it appears the person was touching something they weren’t, or even add elements to the frame that weren’t there in real life. Google hasn’t said whether the manipulated photographs will be labeled as such, though it did mention it would be watermarking images that were entirely generated by computers.

Matter and Smart Home

We always seem to be on the cusp of the real and helpful—and not annoying—smart home. But what will it take to tip that expectation over the edge into reality? Google bets that small, incremental improvements will slowly tempt you to incorporate more connected devices into your home, like the fabric-covered Pixel tablet that functions as a portable Nest hub with one-tap access to a newly redesigned Google Home app. Other sweeteners include easier access to Google Home from your Wear OS smartwatch and a new control panel for your home that runs on Android tablets. Google is even—gulp—building tools to provide Matter support for iOS users.

Google didn’t spend a lot of time touting the relatively new Matter smart home standard during the I/O keynote. But it did let us know in briefings that in just a few weeks, you’ll be able to control Matter devices in the Google Home app from iOS devices. Any family member can access the panel, or switch profiles. As they say, if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em … in putting a Matter sticker on every home appliance.

Android Auto

In something of a plodding reply to Apple’s startling plans for CarPlay 2 announced in June last year, Google’s Android Auto team finally has news to share. It didn’t come during the I/O keynote, but it came in side-briefings before the show.

Cottoning on to the fact that people are sitting in their vehicles with little to do while at charging stations, Android Auto will soon support video, gaming, and browsing in cars. Apparently, YouTube will be available in Polestars, which already run on a Google OS, in the coming weeks. Games mentioned include Beach Buggy Racing 2 (will you be able to play using the steering wheel?), and Solitaire FRVR (yawn). Apple’s version, rather than working alongside the existing car software, will supposedly replace it entirely—so this Android automotive update feels “lite” in comparison. Still, car companies will likely be happier with Google’s less aggressive approach here. Android Auto is also working with Cisco, Microsoft, and Zoom to enable conference calls, so you can join meetings by audio directly from the car display. Gaming, browsing the web, and conference calls ... this is hardly bleeding-edge tech. It’s also worth noting that if you’re sitting and charging your EV, you can do all this from your phone anyway. But any improvement to the in-car Android experience is welcome.",https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-2023-everything-announced/,,,,,,,,
5/10/2023 16:00,Google Is Racing to Bring More AI to Android ,"IN THE DAYS leading up to its annual software conference, Google executives were unusually excited about … wallpaper. Phone wallpaper. Wallpaper that changes and breathes and undulates on Android phones, specifically. Wallpaper that’s generated by artificial intelligence after tapping a few prompts on your phone screen. 

“Generative AI” is the key phrase here. It’s the category of artificial intelligence that tech companies both big and small are hanging their futures on right now. Alphabet-owned Google is one of the pioneers in this space; as Google executives like to remind people, the “T” in OpenAI’s ChatGPT actually refers to transformer technology that Google introduced back in 2017. And Google has been working on humanlike chatbot technology for years. 

But now Google is largely perceived as being behind in generative AI, since both OpenAI and Microsoft (which funds OpenAI) released their GenAI chat tools before Google had a chance to unleash its own tool, called Bard. The release of ChatGPT even reportedly triggered a “code red” for Google, leading the company to funnel more resources into building AI products, and yesterday. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

So it makes sense that Google would use I/O, its annual developer conference that kicked off today in Mountain View, California, as a stage to tout its latest AI features. AI is the thread woven throughout the program. It’s also featuring prominently in two new Android-specific features, demonstrating just how eager Google is to unleash usable products around generative AI and get into the hands of potentially billions of people. 

“We’re in this position where Google has pioneered much of the seminal research, particularly around this class of large language models, which is the basis of this nonlinear step forward in tech,” Dave Burke, vice president of engineering for Android, said in an interview with WIRED. “And at the same time we have these large surfaces of Android. And we can bring the two things together.” 

“For Google, the Android ecosystem offers a platform to prove its innovative AI portfolio at a scale that not all of their cloud peers can compete with,” says Chirag Dekate, vice president and analyst at Gartner.

Picture This

The new suite of generative wallpapers for Android seem basic but use varying levels of AI. There’s a customizable emoji option and a “cinematic” mode that turns still photos into mini movies. The latter uses on-device machine learning to determine what’s foreground in the image and what’s background, then creates a subtly zooming parallax effect. Generative AI wallpaper is more, well, generative: The user will tap on a series of predetermined prompts offered on the phone, like “classic arts,” “City by the bay,” and “Post-Impressionist,” which then generates entirely new and original wallpapers.

Google says its image-generation model is trained on public domain artwork, which means it’s likely hoping to head off any sticky ethical issues around the AI art copyright. It also won’t be available to the masses right away: The wallpapers will roll out only to Google’s own Pixel phones first, starting next month. 

So … wallpaper? Google’s seminal research has resulted in AI Van Gogh on your phone? Well, yes, but Burke insists that while “it might seem obvious or simple in retrospect, this is one of the ways we’re thinking that AI can be applied in a very user-centric, responsible way.”",https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-features-coming-to-android/,,,,,,,,
5/10/2023 15:04,"Google’s Pixel Fold Is Finally Here, but It’s Not Cheap","SMARTPHONE SALES HAVE been declining lately, mostly because the smartphones themselves have not been changing drastically year over year. A slightly better camera here, a nicer screen there—the technology has plateaued. The solution, according to tech companies? Folding smartphones that cost $1,799. That's what the Pixel Fold is. 

Google isn't first to the folding phone party—Samsung is well past its fourth iteration already—but the company knows that while smartphone sales may be down, smartphone usage is going up. (It also helps that foldable smartphone sales are going up too.) Brian Rakowski, vice president of product management for Pixel at Google, says he believes there's “tremendous value” in a product like the Pixel Fold, as it opens up many more uses than a traditional single-screen smartphone. 

The company teased the Pixel Fold last week on its social channels, but it officially took the wraps off during the Google I/O 2023 keynote. The Fold isn't available just yet, though preorders are now live, with the promise the Fold will ship in June. Google is also tossing in a free Pixel Watch with every purchase. Here's everything you need to know about the Pixel Fold.

I had a very brief time with the Pixel Fold, but if you've ever tried a Pixel 6 Pro or Pixel 7 Pro, it feels exactly like that but … it also folds. The Google hardware design ethos carries through, firmly cementing this phone as a Pixel, though I wish there was a snazzy color option (it only comes in Obsidian and Porcelain). Most impressive is the thinness, which Rakowski says was a priority for the team. At just 0.5 inches in its folded state and 0.2 inches when unfolded, it's just slightly thinner than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4 (though slightly heavier). 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Is it drastically more pocketable or manageable than Samsung's foldable? I don't think so, but I'll need more time with the phone to say for sure. It still looks big and awkward when you see it next to a traditional smartphone. It likely won't fit in some pockets.

The 5.8-inch OLED screen on the front of the folded phone (which has a fast 120-Hz screen refresh rate) is decently wide and feels quite similar to a normal smartphone, if a little compact, when you're using it. Open the Fold up and you're treated to a 7.6-inch OLED panel with a 2K resolution (also with a 120-Hz screen). And yes, when you open an app on the front screen and unfold the Pixel Fold, it'll launch immediately with no delay on the larger inside screen. 

The outer screen and the glass covering the rear of the phone are Gorilla Glass Victus, which should offer some decent durability, but the inner screen is made of ultra-thin glass with a plastic layer. The stainless steel hinge that holds it all together offers up to 180 degrees of movement. (Google says it has tested it by folding it more than 200,000 times with no issues.) You can position the hinge in a variety of different angles, and thanks to the flat sides, the Pixel Fold can stay upright by itself. This enables a few tricks, like propping the phone up to take a photo with the primary camera on the rear, while using the front screen as a viewfinder.

5/10/2023 14:52,Google’s Pixel 7A Raises the Bar for Sub-$500 Phones,"THE PAST WEEK has been one of the busiest I've ever had. I flew to Dallas, Texas, for a friend's wedding, drove to Austin to visit an in-law, drove back for the wedding festivities, then flew back to New York, only to head out to San Francisco the next day for Google I/O 2023. The good news is that the new Google Pixel 7A has been in my pocket all the while, through every leg and layover, and it's never felt limited in any deal-breaking way. This is a $499 phone, and it's just more evidence that you really don't need to spend much more than that to get a good experience these days.

Is it the perfect phone? No. There are features missing here that some folks would want. Also, battery life is just OK, and the price has been hiked up $50 from last year's model. To remedy this, Google is continuing to sell last year's Pixel 6A at a lower price—$349—though you can routinely find it for sale at $299. That phone is still a good buy at either of those prices, but should you feel the need to spend a bit more, the Pixel 7A has just about everything you'd need.

The New Standard

The Pixel 7A mimics the design of the Pixel 7 and Pixel 6 series that came before. It's clean and unique, and it's easy to spot in a sea of iPhones and Samsungs—good if you want to feel different. It comes in Charcoal (black), Sea (baby blue), Snow (white), and Coral (orangey pink), the latter of which is exclusive to the Google Store. The blue is a little too faint for me—it often looks white—but the Coral is drop-dead gorgeous. I love a flashy phone.

The phone's frame is made of recycled aluminum, and the back is a plastic composite that by no means feels cheap. (It's also one less spot for cracked glass in case you drop the phone!) The front is made with Gorilla Glass 3, a product which is several years old at this point and isn't as scratch- and crack-resistant as modern formulations from Corning, the company that creates the hardened glass. Using older Gorilla Glass is one of the easy ways to bring down the price of a handset. Safe to say, even if the back can't crack as easily, it's worth getting a case. This Pixel is IP67-rated for water and dust resistance though, so a drop in the pool won't destroy it.

PHOTOGRAPH: JULIAN CHOKKATTU

The 6.1-inch OLED screen hasn't shown any weaknesses, even when I stared at it while walking in full sun (not to mention 94-degree heat paired with disgusting levels of humidity) in Austin. Is it as bright as the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G, the Pixel's closest competitor? No, but I rarely had to squint to read the display. You're treated to a 90-Hz refresh rate as well, which means everything from playing games to scrolling Instagram feels more fluid, as the screen is outputting more frames per second than traditional 60-Hz screens. It's a nice perk.

Performance is not an issue either. The Pixel 7A packs Google's Tensor G2 chipset with 8 gigabytes of RAM, the very same stack that powers its flagship Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. I've never seen the 7A stutter in my time with the phone. This chipset means you get access to many of the same G2-specific software features that debuted on the Pixel 7 series, such as Long Exposure in the camera app and Photo Unblur, which did effectively unblur some faces in my photos of the dance floor at the wedding.

The Pixel 7A is one of the few sub-$500 phones to feature wireless charging, and it's about damn time this started showing up in cheaper phones. It's so much nicer to plop your phone on a stand instead of hunting for a cable. That said, the 7A does skip some other niceties you might have liked to see, like a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, and a wall charger in the box (though you do get a USB-C to USB-C cable). The phone is also limited to 128 GB of internal storage; it'd be nice if Google took a page from Motorola and started offering 256 gigs.

Google has long had a lackluster in-display fingerprint sensor, and unfortunately the Pixel 7A follows that same path. On my first day of use, I had to put my thumb on the sensor a few times for it to unlock. It got drastically better over time, but I still needed to be more conscious and deliberate about finger placement than I was on other phones such as the aforementioned A54. It's just not a great sensor.",https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-7a/,,,,,,,,
5/10/2023 14:00,The Weird Way Australia’s Bushfires Influenced a Weirder La Niña,"THE COLOSSAL BUSHFIRES that tore through Australia in 2019 and 2020 charred some 37,500 square miles, obliterating iconic ecosystems and pushing already-threatened species to the brink. The blazes were so big they spawned their own towering thunderclouds.

Thousands of miles away, clear across the Pacific Ocean, the bushfires were affecting something more subtle yet very consequential: New modeling shows that the smoke helped cool the waters off South America, greatly increasing the chances of the rare three-year La Niña that ensued. That’s the band of chilled water in the Pacific that lasted from late 2020 to early 2023. La Niña influences weather around the world, so the bushfires ended up having a widespread effect, long after the last embers stopped glowing in Australia. 

“It skewed the probabilities toward a La Niña event for multiple years,” says John Fasullo, a climate scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research and lead author of a new paper describing the modeling, which was published today in Science Advances. “This is actually—in terms of the historical records—one of the largest perturbations to the Southern Hemisphere that we've seen.”

COURTESY OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH

Check out the map above. As fires raged in Australia in December 2019, smoke (high concentrations are shown in red) blew not only across the Pacific Ocean but also wrapped around the Southern Hemisphere. Up in the atmosphere, those innumerable aerosol particles—charred plant material, even bits of structures that had burned—became little nuclei for water to condense upon. This is how clouds form normally, when water aggregates around dust particles. But in the Southern Hemisphere, there aren’t a whole lot of these nuclei blowing around. (In the Northern Hemisphere, there are more land masses to provide particulate matter.)

“Having this huge source of the Australian wildfires actually had a big effect and created all these cloud condensation nuclei. And, in turn, that made the clouds brighter,” says Fasullo.

5/10/2023 13:59,Google Just Added Generative AI to Search,"SIX MONTHS AGO, Google didn’t appear remotely worried about its search business. Then OpenAI’s ChatGPT was unleashed, and Microsoft’s Bing spawned a chatbot.

At Google’s annual I/O conference today, the search giant announced that it will infuse results with generative artificial intelligence technology similar to that behind ChatGPT. The company is launching an experimental version of its prized search engine that incorporates text generation like that powering ChatGPT and other advanced chatbots.

Google’s reimagined search still involves typing a query, and it still responds with links to websites, snippets of content, and ads. But in some situations, the top of the page will feature text synthesized by AI that pulls from information found on different sources across the web, and link to those webpages. A user can ask follow up questions to get more specific information.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

A query about the coronation of Britain’s new king might be met with a couple of paragraphs summarizing the event. If asked about ebikes, Google’s algorithms can list bullet-point recaps of product reviews published by various websites, and link to online stores where a user can make a purchase. The revamped version of search will be accessible in the US via a new feature called Search Labs, but it will not be activated by default or for all Google users.

Google’s AI-infused search is considerably tamer than ChatGPT, eschewing an anthropomorphized persona and avoiding topics that might be deemed controversial, such as politics and medical or financial advice. When asked if Joe Biden is a good president or for information about different US states’ abortion laws, for example, Google’s generative AI product declined to answer. 

“The technology is very early on, it has its challenges, and we will make mistakes certainly,” says Liz Reid, vice president of search at Google, who gave WIRED a preview of the new features ahead of I/O.

VIDEO: GOOGLE

Google is moving quickly to add ChatGPT-like features to search, but whether users will find them useful remains to be seen. Product searches, for instance, synthesized material from different reviews, but it was not immediately obvious how the brief summaries might improve the search experience.

The unpolished feel of these new features may reflect the fact that their launch is a defensive move. Google has invested huge sums and major resources in AI over recent years, with CEO Sundar Pichai often calling the company “AI first.” Yet Google still found itself wrong-footed with the arrival of ChatGPT, a surprisingly clever and garrulous—though also fundamentally flawed—chatbot from OpenAI.

ChatGPT is powered by a machine learning model trained to predict the words likely to follow a string of text by digesting huge amounts of text, including vast numbers of web pages. Additional training, provided by humans rating the quality of the bot’s responses, made ChatGPT more adept at answering questions and holding a conversation. ",https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-just-added-generative-ai-to-search/,,,,,,,,
5/10/2023 11:11,The Ted Lasso Fandom’s Push for Polyamory Just Makes Sense,"THERE’S A MOMENT in this week’s episode of Apple TV+’s Ted Lasso, “La Locker Room Aux Folles,” when player Jan Maas points out that if 10 percent of the population is gay, statistically there would be members of the Greyhounds club who identify as such. After everyone lets that sink in, gazes turn to Jamie Tartt, who then notices, touches his heart, and tenderly says “I’m flattered.”

To the casual Ted Lasso fan, that kind reaction might seem like a mild gag about Jamie’s love of hair products, but for the show’s fervent and wide-ranging queer community, it feels like acknowledgement of what many have believed for years: that Jamie is one of the most deeply queer-coded characters on the show, even given Trent and Colin’s quiet coming out parties this season.

Sparking countless GIFs; specialized Discord channels; and hundreds of loving, emotional, and deeply saucy pieces of fanfiction on Tumblr and Archive of Our Own, the idea of the throuple was born of the show’s investment in the emotional development and vulnerability of all three characters, who started off the show as sort of spiritual and romantic rivals but have grown to deeply care for and respect each other.

Christa, who goes by Mixtapestar on A03 and who, like nearly all the sources for this story, requested anonymity because they don’t want their workplaces and families knowing about their participation in the sometimes NSFW fanfiction world, says that the way she sees it, the seeds for the throuple were laid during the first season’s gala episode, where Jamie, Roy, and Keeley were all seated at the same table. As the show has gone on and the characters have grown and matured, she says, the argument for the throuple has become more about chemistry. “It’s about a feeling that [the characters] all genuinely support each other in their own ways and that could lead to a relationship,” Christa explains.

“So many people identify with Roy, Jamie, and Keeley because they really exemplify the show’s thesis of being a work-in-progress,” says Elizabeth, a Lasso fan who also requested anonymity. “The writers have already done the work to show that they all love and trust each other, and assuming Roy and Keeley make up, the three of them would just have to have, like, one conversation. And maybe kiss a little.”",https://www.wired.com/story/ted-lasso-polyamory-throuple-fanfic-fandom/,,,,,,,,
5/10/2023 9:00,"With Silo, Apple TV+ Strikes Prestige Sci-Fi Gold","WHEN HUGH HOWEY’S self-published novel Wool became a runaway hit in 2011, its unlikely success nearly overshadowed its narrative merits. Howey became a ballyhooed poster boy for Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing—and Wool got dubbed “the sci-fi version of Fifty Shades of Grey,” a comparison so rude it’s almost libelous. People were fascinated by an industry outsider rocketing onto the bestseller list thanks to online buzz alone, even if they never bothered reading the book. 

That’s too bad—it’s an engrossing, pulpy yarn. In 2012, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to Wool and its prequel Shift after an intense bidding war, with Ridley Scott attached to direct. Fans waited to see when production would begin. Then they waited some more.

While they waited, the world changed. Howey published a third novel, Dust, and called the trilogy “the Silo saga.” Netflix, which had just released its first original series when Howey started posting chapters of Wool online, grew into a juggernaut, and inspired altogether too many imitators. Game of Thrones, in its first season when Wool was published, became a cultural phenomenon. Every television executive wanted their own dragon show. Streamers poured money into replicating HBO’s success, frequently favoring lavish sci-fi and fantasy epics. These streamers included Apple, which placed big bets on shows like Foundation and For All Mankind. Some succeeded. More flopped.

Now that Apple TV+'s Silo is finally here, more than a decade after that first adaptation attempt, it faces the danger of appearing unoriginal, just another entry in a crowded field of aspiring dystopia-flavored tentpoles. If it had debuted on the original schedule, back when you could count the number of streaming services on your hands, the bar to distinguish itself wouldn’t be quite so high. At this point, though, audiences know their way around a grim, futuristic hellscape. We’re harder to impress than those Obama-era naifs downloading Wool and sharing a Kony 2012 video on Facebook while wearing skinny jeans. 

We have Dystopia Fatigue Syndrome. 

Watching Silo can feel familiar. The show’s opening credits sound like a riff on the portentous theme from Westworld, and the show can strike a similarly self-serious tone. Like every other new prestige drama, it includes a Game of Thrones alum (Iain Glen, aka Ser Jorah Mormont). The dialog can occasionally go rote, like Prestige Drama Mad Libs. (“You need to trust me!” “This is getting dangerous.” “Try not to get yourself killed.” Stuff like that.) And Silo’s premise is a lot like the inferior television version of Snowpiercer—like TNT’s show, it is a murder mystery set in a mysterious, intensely class-stratified postapocalyptic society confined within a tight space as the possibility of rebellion foments. 

There’s two crucial differences between the TNT Snowpiercer and Silo, though. Instead of a train perpetually circumnavigating a ruined Earth, the setting for Silo is, as the title suggests, a 144-story silo buried beneath a ruined Earth. More importantly, instead of being bad, Silo is good. ",https://www.wired.com/story/silo-apple-tv-plus-review/,,,,,,,,

5/10/2023 7:00,Twitter’s Purge of Old Accounts Will Be Pure Chaos,"MARIANN HARDEY’S FATHER died unexpectedly a little over a decade ago. But he lives on through his Twitter account. It only has 42 followers, and it was locked by Hardey’s father so no one but those 42 people can see it. And with a common first name and surname-based username, it’s likely a sought-after bit of online real estate.

“I regularly check in with him over social media,” says Hardey, a sociology professor at Durham Business School in the UK. The profile—the last tweet of which praised Hardey for her braveness in getting a wisdom tooth removed—is doubly important to the professor because its profile picture is a kitten, Penny, that Hardey’s family lost last year.

That could soon change. Twitter CEO Elon Musk has announced a purge of dormant accounts—having previously claimed there are 1.5 billion on the platform. As a result, Hardey’s father’s Twitter account, which hasn’t been updated since March 14, 2012, could soon be wiped from the internet. “He has a granddaughter now who he has never met, and his social media quips and content show her who he was, and what we meant to each other,” Hardey says. “Social media is about connections.”

FEATURED VIDEO

 

It’s a move that, as with so much on Musk’s Twitter, could be chaotic. Single-word or -letter Twitter accounts, long-dormant profiles of celebrities who have died, like Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington, and cherished brands that have abandoned Twitter or were taken over by squatters, such as @Nintendo3DS, could all be taken over by new owners.

“It might sound like the closure of a few dormant accounts, but the consequence is the reckless endangerment of enormous swathes of evidence, all to create a synthetic market in usernames,” says William Kilbride, executive director of the Digital Preservation Coalition. Kilbride compares Musk’s decision to “burning the public record to sell personalized number plates.” It’s just the latest example of big platforms making changes to the permanence of the content hosted on their platforms, after Imgur and Tumblr switched policy on the hosting of pornographic material, removing huge swathes of their content. Musk has said purged accounts will be “archived,” without providing more information.

The planned purge is especially problematic as Twitter is seen by many, including Musk himself, as a de facto public square of the internet—vast swathes of which could soon vanish. “When you have these gigantic global systems, changes have to be instituted very carefully,” says Mar Hicks, associate professor of the history of technology at Illinois Institute of Technology.

It’s one of the perils of private ownership of public platforms that act as quasi-utilities. “Twitter has been relatively small, but it's had an outsized influence, because it's the place where journalists go,” Hicks says. “For it to descend into chaos, in multiple ways, is really dangerous.” One example of what could potentially be lost if the plan goes ahead: the loss (or repurposing) of Syrian activist Raed Fares, whose account—and record of human rights abuses—remains crystallized in amber following his November 2018 assassination.",https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-purge-old-accounts/,,,,,,,,
5/10/2023 7:00,Free All-Terrain Chairs Are Making the Great Outdoors Even Better,"BEN OXLEY WAS 35 years old when he connected with nature for the first time. Born with cerebral palsy, he’d spent his whole life in a wheelchair, unable to access hiking trails or rugged parks without the help of some very dedicated friends and serious equipment. However, that changed recently when Oxley visited Red Top Mountain State Park in Acworth, Geaorgia, about an hour from his home. He wanted to try one of the park’s cool new offerings: an all-terrain chair (ATC).  

“It had been six or seven years since I last visited a park,” says Oxley, who grew up in Georgia and has never left the southeast US. “I’ve been down because I don’t have a caretaker right now, and I just didn’t know what to do. But when I got in that chair for the first time and got myself comfortable, it opened up a whole new world for me. All my struggles just went away. I really got to experience nature for the first time independently. I’ve been in nature before, but I was more in control of my environment and where I wanted to go.”

There are many types of all-terrain mobility devices, ranging in price from a couple grand up to $20,000. The brand that Oxley rented for free at Red Top Mountain is known as an Action Trackchair, a battery-powered wheelchair with tank-like treads. He described it as a “mini bulldozer” that can go over rocks, roots, across streams, logs, and even over downed trees. That day exploring Red Top Mountain was life-changing for Oxley. “I was out there about four hours,” he says. “I was able to feel the breeze by the water. With a regular power chair your wheels get stuck in the mud, but this time I was able to get down by the river, get next to the water, and have my buddy stand next to me and take cool pictures of me.”

FEATURED VIDEO

 

These free-to-use ATCs are the result of a new partnership, called All Terrain Georgia, between the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Aimee Copeland Foundation, a nonprofit that creates more recreational opportunities and outdoor accessibility for people with disabilities. Last November, the foundation unveiled a fleet of 12 new Trackchairs (at $12,500 a piece) to be shared among certain Georgia State Parks.

COURTESY OF AIMEE COPELAND FOUNDATION

“Having these chairs available is a game changer for so many people like me, who love nature but can’t access the beauty of the outdoors without specialized equipment,” says Aimee Copeland Mercier, who created the Aimee Copeland Foundation in 2017. Copeland Mercier is a licensed clinical social worker with a background in eco-psychology. “The idea for the foundation actually came to me 10 years ago while I was in the hospital recuperating. My research in the field of eco-psychology taught me that nature is inherently connected to the human psyche. We’re part of nature, and being immersed in that home consistently reminds me what is truly important and brings so much peace and renewal.”

After a 2012 zip-lining accident left Copeland Mercier with necrotizing fasciitis (a flesh-eating bacterial infection), she lost both her hands, her right foot, and her entire left leg. Just 24 years old at the time, she struggled to adapt to life in a wheelchair. “After my injury, I realized if I wanted to get out there again it was going to take technology to bridge the gap between wilderness and accessibility,” says Copeland Mercier. “I didn’t want boardwalks and sidewalks; I wanted to do back country. So I tried out all the technology that exists and ended up buying an all-terrain chair personally because they’re so badass!”

After deciding on the Action Trackchair, Copeland Mercier and her foundation designed a registration process and protocol that would protect not only participants using the chairs but also the soil and ecology in these parks. Reserving an ATC is free (though some parks do charge for parking) and includes an online training course on how to responsibly and safely use the adaptive equipment. Copeland Mercier says the certification course takes about an hour, and the foundation and parks require 72 hours notice to move adaptive equipment to parks where it has been reserved. 

There are numerous organizations scattered across the country like the Aimee Copeland Foundation that loan ATCs to parks, preserves, and counties. Whereas All Terrain Georgia requires training and a buddy system, some don’t require either. There’s no national ATC loaner organization, and so far most state parks have preferred working with outside partners to provide or maintain the technology. ",https://www.wired.com/story/free-all-terrain-chairs-national-state-park-accessibility/,,,,,,,,

5/10/2023 6:00,A Mysterious New Hacker Group Is Lurking in Ukraine’s Cyberspace,"UKRAINIAN NETWORKS HAVE been on the receiving end of grimly sophisticated and innovative cyberattacks from Russia for nearly a decade, and Ukraine has increasingly struck back, particularly since the Kremlin's invasion last year. Amidst all of this and activity from other governments and hacktivists, researchers from the security firm Malwarebytes say that they've been tracking a new hacking group that has been conducting espionage operations since 2020 against both pro-Ukraine targets in central Ukraine and pro-Russia targets in eastern Ukraine. 

Malwarebytes attributes five operations between 2020 and the present to the group, which it has dubbed Red Stinger, though the researchers only have insights into two of the campaigns conducted in the past year. The group's motives and allegiance aren't yet clear, but the digital campaigns are noteworthy for their persistence, aggressiveness, and lack of ties to other known actors.

The campaign that Malwarebytes calls “Operation Four” targeted a member of Ukraine's military who works on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, as well as other individuals whose potential intelligence value is less obvious. During this campaign, attackers compromised victims' devices to exfiltrate screenshots and documents, and even record audio from their microphones. In Operation Five, the group targeted multiple election officials running Russian referendums in disputed cities in Ukraine, including Donetsk and Mariupol. One target was an adviser to Russia's Central Election Commission, and another works on transportation—possibly railroad infrastructure—in the region.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

“We were surprised about how big these targeted operations were, and they were able to gather a lot of information,” says Roberto Santos, a threat intelligence researcher at Malwarebytes. Santos collaborated on the investigation with former colleague Hossein Jazi, who first identified Red Stinger activity. “We have seen past targeted surveillance, but the fact that they were collecting real microphone recordings from victims and data from USB drives, it's unusual to see.”

Researchers from the security firm Kaspersky first published about Operation 5 in late March, naming the group behind it Bad Magic. Kaspersky similarly saw the group focusing on government and transportation targets in eastern Ukraine, along with agricultural targets.

“The malware and techniques used in this campaign are not particularly sophisticated, but are effective, and the code has no direct relation to any known campaigns,” Kaspersky researchers wrote.

The campaigns begin with phishing attacks to distribute malicious links that lead to tainted ZIP files, malicious documents, and special Windows linking files. From there, attackers deploy basic scripts to act as a backdoor and a loader for malware. The Malwarebytes researchers note that Red Stinger seems to have developed its own hacking tools and reuses characteristic scripts and infrastructure, including specific malicious URL generators and IP addresses. The researchers were able to expand their understanding of the group's operations after discovering two victims who appear to have infected themselves with Red Stinger malware while testing it.

“It's happened in the past with different attackers that they infect themselves,” Santos says. “I think they just got lazy because they were undetected since 2020.”

Red Stinger appears to be currently active. With details about its operations now entering the public sphere, the group may tweak its methods and tools in an attempt to evade detection. The Malwarebytes researchers say that by releasing information about the group's activities, they hope other organizations will deploy detections for Red Stinger operations and search their own telemetry for additional indications of what the hackers have done in the past and who is behind the group.",https://www.wired.com/story/red-stinger-russia-ukraine-apt/,,,,,,,,

5/10/2023 2:00,This European Satellite Giant Is Coming for Starlink,"EVA BERNEKE DESCRIBES her first year at the helm of the world’s third-largest satellite company as a “whirlwind.” That’s an understatement. Since she took over the top job at Eutelsat in January 2022, the Danish CEO has become a direct competitor to Elon Musk, been accused by the Ukrainian government of aiding Russian propaganda, and found herself in the thick of bitter Brexit politics—and that’s before you even mention the Iranian sabotage attempt.

Despite all this, Berneke gives the impression that she has everything under control. When she arrived at Eutelsat, the French company’s bread-and-butter business was beaming TV channels into homes using geostationary satellites—which move at the same speed as Earth and so stay in a fixed position. The organization she inherited was stable and solid, she says—but also stagnating in an industry that is undergoing radical change. Although Eutelsat was starting to use its geostationary fleet to offer satellite internet, its TV revenues were dwindling.

The entrance of two of the world’s richest men—Elon Musk with SpaceX’s Starlink network and Jeff Bezos with Project Kuiper—was also beginning to change the way incumbents thought about their future. “When you have two of the biggest business innovators getting interested in your industry, you should expect a little bit of shaking up,” says Berneke.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Undaunted, Berneke responded by initiating her own shake-up. In July, the company announced plans to merge with struggling British satellite provider OneWeb. As part of the deal, Eutelsat absorbed OneWeb’s constellation of 648 low-orbit satellites. At just 1,200 km above Earth, the OneWeb fleet delivers faster internet speeds than Eutelsat’s geostationary satellites, which sit 35,000 km above the planet’s surface.

OneWeb is Eutelsat’s ticket to the booming low-orbit satellite market. Rural homes, ships, airlines, militaries, and autonomous vehicles are turning to satellite internet to stay connected in places previously considered dead zones.

“Even in France, a country with very high fiber and 5G coverage, it’s estimated that around 4 percent of households are without good connectivity,” says Berneke. She expects this figure to rise to 15 percent of households in countries with less fiber and 5G. “So it’s not that small a niche.”

The OneWeb-Eutelsat merger has been touted as Europe’s entry into the space race. It is the only company currently competing with Musk’s Starlink in the low-orbit market. But to claim its title as a European space giant, Eutelsat first has to navigate messy post-Brexit politics. Both France’s Eutelsat and Britain’s OneWeb were part-owned by their respective governments, and the two countries will continue to own stakes in the new business.

Berneke admits Brexit has brought challenges. “But there’s been a willingness on both sides to reach across the Channel to try and find a good way of collaborating,” she says. If Europe wants a homegrown satellite giant, Britain and France will have to resolve their differences. “[OneWeb’s fleet] is going to be one of the only non-US-based constellations for a while,” she says.

Brexit politics are not the only hurdle. OneWeb’s Gen One satellites need upgrading, and Eutelsat is planning to have more advanced Gen Two satellites in orbit by 2027. Berneke says this upgrade will cost 3 billion to 4 billion euros ($3.3-4.4 billion), a bold move for a company with a reputation for playing it safe.",https://www.wired.com/story/satellite-giant-eutelsat-starlink/,,,,,,,,
5/9/2023 15:44,Brazil Proposed Internet Regulation. Big Tech Dug In Its Heels,"ON APRIL 28, Felipe Neto, a Brazilian YouTuber with more than 45 million followers, was angry. He had just received a message from YouTube warning him about PL2630, a bill in Brazil’s National Congress dubbed the “Fake News Law” that would regulate online platforms. Influencers like Neto, the company said, could be forced to take down content to avoid lawsuits, and the government might be able to control parts of YouTube’s platform.

To Neto, that warning was itself fake news. He felt that the message, and a similar post on YouTube’s blog, mischaracterized the proposed legislation. “The attempt to manipulate creators against the bill was clear,” Neto says. In response, he Tweeted the message from YouTube along with his own replies to its statements, warning other content producers to “read carefully, because I have never seen such a heavy attempt to use creators to defend Google's interests.”

Neto was responding to just one part of a multipronged effort in Brazil by Google and several other major US technology companies to beat back a bill that sought to impose a new regulatory structure on them. It would require platforms and search engines to find and remove hate speech, misinformation, and other illegal content or be subject to fines. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

In the weeks leading up to a congressional vote scheduled early this month, Brazilians noticed a bombardment of ads and company statements pushing back on the proposed law. Ads on Instagram, Facebook, and in national newspapers linked to a Google blog post calling for an extended debate on the bill. The post said that some parts of the bill had not been debated in Congress, and that the timing of the vote had limited “the space for discussion and possibilities for improving the text in Congress.” 

Last week, just 24 hours before Brazil’s National Congress was set to vote on the bill, users in the country opening up the Google homepage were greeted with a link below the Search box that read, “The fake news bill could increase confusion about what is true or false in Brazil.” Google removed the link after the country’s Ministry of Justice said it would fine the company up to $200,000 per hour for what the agency called a “propaganda campaign” violating the consumer protection laws.

“You have to make it transparent that someone paid for [a message], that it’s a company’s position, and that’s why it’s there,” says Estela Aranha, digital rights secretary for the Brazilian Ministry of Justice. Rafael Corrêa, director of communications and public affairs at Google Brazil describes the company’s push against the bill as a “marketing campaign to give broader visibility to our concerns” and likened it to previous campaigns on matters of public interest such as to promote voting or Covid-19 vaccinations. He says the notice sent to Neto and others was an attempt to explain “legitimate” risks of the bill.

The vote on the bill was stalled last week due to an influx of last-minute amendments, but the way US tech platforms, particularly Google, sought to shape public debate over the law has sparked increased concern among experts and government officials in Brazil. The industry’s attempts to fend off new regulation may now lead to it receiving even more scrutiny.

Wake Up Call

The need for social media regulation has, to some in Brazil, felt greater since January 8th, when thousands of people stormed the National Congress in support of defeated right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro. Like the assault on the US Congress in 2021, the Brazilian uprising was fomented on platforms like Telegram, and activist groups found that advertisements questioning the integrity of the elections repeatedly slipped through Meta’s systems. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as “Lula,” has been open about the need to regulate platforms more aggressively.

“The platforms were unprepared, but most importantly, unwilling to take tough measures against hate speech and disinformation around elections,” says Flora Arduini, campaign director at the advocacy group Ekō. “For the Lula government, January 8 was really the moment where they felt, ‘We need to take this debate forward to effectively regulate the platforms.’”",https://www.wired.com/story/brazil-regulation-big-tech/,,,,,,,,
5/9/2023 15:00,The 13 Best Movies on Hulu This Week,"IN 2017, Hulu made television history by becoming the first streaming network to win the Outstanding Drama Series Emmy, thanks to the phenomenon that is The Handmaid’s Tale. While that painfully prescient adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 dystopian novel remains one of the best TV shows to watch on Hulu, it also set a bar for quality entertainment that the network has continued to match—and sometimes exceed—with original series like The Bear, The Great, and Only Murders in the Building. 

While Netflix has largely cornered the streaming market on original movies, and even managed to convince A-listers like Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón, and Martin Scorsese to come aboard, Hulu is starting to find its footing in features too. Below are some of our top picks for the best movies (original and otherwise) streaming on Hulu right now.

The Hunger Games Series 

It’s hard to believe it’s been a decade since these movies first took over the cultural zeitgeist—and made Jennifer Lawrence an intergalactic superstar—but here we are. Based on Suzanne Collins’ wildly successful young adult series, the Hunger Games movies focus on a teenager, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence), who, say it with me, volunteers as tribute to save her sister from competing in a brutal, televised competition where they fight to the death. It’s no longer a spoiler to say Katniss wins the Hunger Games and in the process becomes a beacon of hope for all the people who have been forced to send their children off to die for years. If you’ve never watched the series, you should. If you have watched it, now is your chance to stream the movies again, just in time for the release of The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, a prequel film coming in November.

Think of it like Gilligan’s Island, but with more class commentary and vomit. When a bunch of rich head out to sea on a luxury yacht, their plans are thwarted when a terrible storm leaves many of them stranded on a beach where none of their money or power can help them survive. That already gives away too much, but suffice to say, if you like Menu-esque critiques of the excesses of wealth with just as many dark-comedy twists, then this Oscar-nominated film is right for you.

Portrait of a Lady on Fire

OK, so this might be the movie that turned the idea of “lesbian period drama” into a trope, but it’s also one of the best modern queer romance films around, alongside Moonlight and Carol. Set on an isolated French coast in the late-1700s, writer-director Céline Sciamma’s film centers on a young aristocrat woman, Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), who is betrothed to a wealthy Milanese man. When Héloïse’s mother hires Mariane (Noémie Merlant) to paint a portrait of her daughter, the two women fall in love and have the kind of heartbreaking affair that have made lesbian period dramas so undeniable in the first place. You’ll be transfixed.

Spencer

Look, there are probably already far too many Princess Diana movies and TV shows, but this one, directed by Pablo Larrain and starring Kristen Stewart as the princess of Wales, focuses on one specific Christmas at Queen Elizabeth’s Sandringham Estate in a way that narrows down just how complex each day Diana’s life with the royal family must have been. Yes, the backdrop are the rumors of divorce surrounding Diana and Prince Charles (Jack Farthing), but the story is about her relationships within the family and the life she left behind to join them.

Nomadland

This film from director Chloé Zhao, about one woman’s post-Great Depression quest through the American West won a ton of Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actress for lead Frances McDormand, and Best Director and Best Editing wins for Zhao. Zhao also won for Best Adapted Screenplay for her adaptation of WIRED contributor Jessica Bruder’s book, also called Nomadland. It’s a bracing look at the modern American dream.

Boston Strangler 

If you’re the kind of viewer who just can’t get enough of murder shows and has been looking for a murder movie, might we suggest Boston Strangler? Based on the real-life serial killer of the same name, writer-director Matt Ruskin’s “reimagining” of the 1968 movie focuses on the two reporters—Loretta McLaughlin (Keira Knightley) and Jean Cole (Carrie Coon)—who uncovered the news about the Strangler’s string of killings in the 1960s and broke the story. If nothing else, it’s worth watching just to see what happens when a Bostonian director forbids his predominantly non-Bostonian cast from trying to imitate the city’s notorious accent.

Fresh 

Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is a single woman on the lookout for a partner, but who is tired of the online dating scene. So when she meets Steve (Sebastian Stan), a quirky, handsome stranger, she takes a chance on giving him her number. The two hit it off on the first date and eventually find themselves making plans to spend a weekend away—which is when Noa realizes that Steve has been hiding a few disturbing details about himself. Ultimately, Fresh stands as a lesson in the horrors of dating in the digital age (both real and imagined).

Good Luck to You, Leo Grande 

Two years after the death of her husband, retired religion teacher Nancy Stokes (Emma Thompson) decides it’s time to do something about the fact that she has never had an orgasm. So she hires Leo Grande (Daryl McCormack), a young male sex worker, and invites him to a hotel room so that she can cross a few items off her sexual bucket list. But what begins as a transactional relationship quickly, and genuinely, evolves into much more.

Palm Springs 

Given the existence of Harold Ramis’ near-perfect Groundhog Day, it takes a whole lot of chutzpah for a filmmaker to add another picture to the infinite-time-loop rom-com canon. But writer-director Max Barbakow went ahead and did it anyway with Palm Springs, and audiences are thankful he did. Building upon the rules originally established in Groundhog Day, Palm Springs offers its own unique twist on the story. Instead of one person (Billy Murray’s Phil Conners) slowly being pushed to the brink of insanity because he’s the only one who seems to be experiencing the phenomenon, Palm Springs sees three wedding guests—Nyles (Andy Samberg), Sarah (Cristin Milioti), and Roy (J. K. Simmons)—living the same day again and again, and working together to find a way out of it.

Rosaline 

Romeo (Kyle Allen) and Juliet (Isabela Merced) regularly nab all the headlines as William Shakespeare’s legendarily star-crossed lovers. But this inventive rom-com from director Karen Maine (Obvious Child) is more concerned with Rosaline (Kaitlyn Dever), Juliet’s cousin—and Romeo’s first love—who is conveniently disposed of in the play. Dever makes up for 400-plus years of lost time as she plots to win her man back in this fun and frilly period rom-com.

5/9/2023 12:00,"A Radical Plan to Make AI Good, Not Evil","IT’S EASY TO freak out about more advanced artificial intelligence—and much more difficult to know what to do about it. Anthropic, a startup founded in 2021 by a group of researchers who left OpenAI, says it has a plan. 

Anthropic is working on AI models similar to the one used to power OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But the startup announced today that its own chatbot, Claude, has a set of ethical principles built in that define what it should consider right and wrong, which Anthropic calls the bot’s “constitution.” 

Jared Kaplan, a cofounder of Anthropic, says the design feature shows how the company is trying to find practical engineering solutions to sometimes fuzzy concerns about the downsides of more powerful AI. “We're very concerned, but we also try to remain pragmatic,” he says. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Anthropic’s approach doesn’t instill an AI with hard rules it cannot break. But Kaplan says it is a more effective way to make a system like a chatbot less likely to produce toxic or unwanted output. He also says it is a small but meaningful step toward building smarter AI programs that are less likely to turn against their creators.

The notion of rogue AI systems is best known from science fiction, but a growing number of experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer of machine learning, have argued that we need to start thinking now about how to ensure increasingly clever algorithms do not also become increasingly dangerous. 

The principles that Anthropic has given Claude consist of guidelines drawn from the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and suggested by other AI companies, including Google DeepMind. More surprisingly, the constitution includes principles adapted from Apple’s rules for app developers, which bar “content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy,” among other things.",https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-ai-chatbots-ethics/,,,,,,,,

What Happens When an Algorithm Helps Write Science Fiction

STEPHEN MARCHE

Later I realized the similarities between tabletop games and ways novelists challenge their narrative choices, from literary constraints to automatic writing to William Burroughs’ cutup method. Sometimes authors even bring in collaborators, be they humans or machines.

The newest collaborative machine that has everyone talking is, of course, ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM) often called artificial intelligence, although its cognizance is nonexistent. Working with ChatGPT, an author inputs a prompt request and can choose from an infinite number of outputs. If you don’t like a paragraph ChatGPT wrote, you can edit your prompt and ask it for another one. These tools can guide anything from character names to plot points. “Alright, ChatGPT, that character in my sci-fi story is a member of the Merry Men? OK, let’s try Robin Hood in outer space.”

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Death of an Author, by Stephen Marche, is the best example yet of the great writing that can be done with an LLM like ChatGPT. Not only is it an exciting read, it’s clearly the product of an astute author and a machine with the equivalent of a million PhDs in genre fiction. ChatGPT read basically the entire internet and all of literature, finding billions of parameters that go into “good” writing.

AT THE LEVEL of narrative, Death of an Author reads like your everyday detective novel, following a scholar of crime and cyber fiction named Augustus Dupin as he races to clear his name while uncovering the greatest mystery of his life: Who killed his favorite author, Peggy Fermin? An AI? A human? An AI posing as a human? And why? 

The story is full of holographic avatars and deceitful tech CEOs, as well as everything you might expect from crime fiction: mysterious letters, hidden codes, nosey journalists, and gruff cops. Clever Easter eggs are hidden throughout the text, referencing the history of mystery novels. The protagonist’s name, for example, is a nod to Edgar Allan Poe’s C. Auguste Dupin, while the dead author’s funeral reads a lot like the beginning of And Then There Were None. 

Death of an Author doesn’t try to hide many of the quirks that come from collaborating with ChatGPT, which favors Thomas Pynchon-esque monikers, like a literary agent named Beverly Bookman, and fake book titles, such as God, Inc. and Tropic of Tundra.

Descriptions also bear an alien, computer imprint in their discordant and nearly nonsensical images. One character walks away “like a record being put back in its sleeve.” Workers at a tech company are compared to “digital mountaineers scaling the face of God for a sprig of robotic edelweiss.” Multiple characters are described as “glowing,” but a fictional version of author Michael Ondaatje gets the most luminous treatment. At one point his “hair was a glistening white, and it radiated a soft aura around him” and later his hair is “radiating a soft aura.” 

The LLM voice is also apparent in several out-of-character moments. Augustus, the staid, academic protagonist, refers to his estranged spouse as “wifey.” At another point, he seems unaware of one of the biggest biographical facts of the murdered author’s life, even though he’d been studying her work for years. These slippages are byproducts not only of the LLM’s idiosyncrasies but of a human author’s process in composing a novel with LLMs the only way currently possible: piecemeal. ",https://www.wired.com/story/death-of-an-author-ai-book-review/,,,,,,,,
5/9/2023 9:00,How Google Docs Proved the Power of Less,"THE CLICHÉ HAS it that sufficiently advanced technologies are indistinguishable from magic. But if you agree with Dan McKinley’s quietly influential essay “Choose Boring Technology,” the desired end state of technologies isn’t to keep being magical but to become boring. Magic relies on the element of surprise, but the last thing you want on a transpacific flight is a surprise from the engine or a surprise passenger in the cockpit. In fact, commercial aviation technology is so advanced that it made flying—a levitation trick if there ever was one—boring.

Released in 2005, Google Docs has long passed the magic phase and graduated into the boring phase, so critiquing it in 2023 feels both anachronistic and overdue. It’s easy to locate its current place but more challenging to assess its original impact, because we’re just bad at remembering how life felt before transformational technologies. So let’s begin from the end: The status of Google Docs today is like that of a long-tenured academic whose early ideas brought about a sea change in the field but who thereafter went on a lifelong sabbatical. Even after its ambition went limp, however, it has remained relevant and influential, a trendsetting piece of software that new generations copy from and try to dethrone. 

WIRED Software Review
Welcome to WIRED Software Review, where we publish critique on the defining cultural artifact of our time.

Feature-wise, Google Docs shows that great software programs hew more to a logic of elimination than of addition. What makes them great isn’t always a larger feature set but how they make certain categories of problems impossible by design. (Similarly, one celebrated “feature” of the Rust programming language is that it makes memory leaks nearly impossible.)

And while its forerunner Microsoft Word was a qualitative improvement over older word processors like WordStar and WordPerfect—which Microsoft Word had decimated to consolidate the market—Google Docs was a categorically different product from word processors, one that made the term “word processor” sound quaint. To defamiliarize Google Docs’ influence, it might help to rewind the frame even further back to the time when another categorical jump happened: when word processors decimated typewriters.

In Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing, Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, a professor of English and digital studies at the University of Maryland, details the changes—both habitual and psychological—that took place when writers started adopting word processors in lieu of typewriters. For those of us who aren’t dexterous users of mechanical typewriters, they can feel claustrophobic and constricting. With any kind of backtracking—scrolling up, deleting characters, moving the cursor backward (who am I kidding, there’s no cursor)—disallowed, it’s like being asked to advance on a narrow bridge without stepping back. (Try writing a high-stakes email without ever hitting backspace.) As swanky as they are, vintage typewriters are unusable for writing unless you are Don DeLillo, which I presume you aren’t.

Unlike the letters inked on a typewriter’s paper substrate, the text displayed on word processors obeys a different metaphysics, thus conferring a much higher degree of freedom. To use the semiotician Daniel Chandler’s phrase, the text onscreen is “suspended inscription.” It’s in an indeterminate and infinitely modifiable state until etched into or printed on a physical medium.

In this way, word processors allowed composition and revision—hitherto two different modes of writing—to become a single process. And as word processors were being adopted widely in the 1980s, Christina Haas, a composition researcher, found that the new graphical interface measurably impacted the “sense of the text” felt by authors. Word processing “allowed writers to grasp a manuscript as a whole, a gestalt,” writes Kirschenbaum, describing how such a mental model emerged. “The entire manuscript was instantly available via search functions. Whole passages could be moved at will, and chapters or sections reordered.” In other words, the linear process of writing got a dimensional upgrade, from 2D to 3D.",https://www.wired.com/story/software-criticism-google-docs-review/,,,,,,,,

Gus Dupin, walking along the stillness of Stony Lake in the gathering night, recognized the sleek motorboat approaching his dock. A girl in a bright yellow sundress jumped off and sprinted to his mailbox, dropping in an envelope before running back. As she set off into the lake, she yelled “an honest-to-God letter” over her shoulder.

Gus Dupin was not accustomed to receiving letters or messages of any kind. His cottage lacked an internet connection and phone service, and that was exactly how he liked it. He had retreated to Stony Lake to escape the responsibilities of his job as a professor teaching crime and cyber fiction at the University of Toronto and the agonies of his recent divorce. So, as he watched the motorboat carve the water in fine white curves, the filament of human contact retreating across the lake, the disappearing boat provoked disquiet and excitement in equal measure.

The envelope smelled slightly sweet and pleasant, and the edges were jagged and uneven. Inside, the invitation was handwritten; the paper thick, luxurious, and handmade.

For a moment, his mind was blank—Gus couldn’t quite grasp how to feel. He was a Peggy Firmin scholar, but he had been so cut off in his cottage that he hadn’t heard the news of her passing. Learning of Peggy Firmin’s death was like learning about the death of an old lover. It was like the closing of a great restaurant in a city where he used to live.

Every year, Gus lectured on her work to a new group of students at the university. He had even written a book about her novel, God, Inc. But Gus had never actually met Peggy Firmin. He would never have dreamed of being invited to her funeral.

He wondered what the invitation meant by Peggy Firmin giving her own eulogy. It wasn’t the first time he had wondered what Peggy Firmin meant.

GUS USUALLY ENJOYED the solitude of being disconnected from the internet and phone. He suddenly ached for news. So, the next morning, he steered his Boston Whaler across Stony Lake, relishing in its smooth surface as the warm sun beamed down and the gentle breeze cooled him. His pocket started buzzing—Gus’s phone buzzed every time he passed the line where his phone service reconnected.

He eased into the marina and made his way to the Regency Cafe, which was already crowded. With their faces fixed to their phones, the cottagers hardly noticed the white clouds scudding overhead or the pungent aroma of the placid lake water, absorbed in their own private information bubbles.

Gus sat down at a booth, opened his phone, and read the first news item that came up when he searched “Peggy Firmin”—a piece from CP24.

Canadian literary icon Peggy Firmin was found shot dead on a bridge on the Leslie Street Spit, a wilderness area on the East Side of Toronto, on August 14. The location was so remote that there were no witnesses to the crime. Toronto Police are treating the incident as a homicide.

According to sources close to the investigation, Firmin was shot once in the right temple. No gun was recovered at the scene. Firmin’s lifeless body was discovered by a group of cyclists early on the morning of August 14.

A prominent and influential figure in Canadian literature, Firmin’s sudden and violent death has shocked the nation’s literary community. Her agent, Beverly Bookman, released a statement: “We have no comment to make at this time. The apparent murder of Peggy Firmin should horrify anyone who cares about language.”",https://www.wired.com/story/death-of-an-author-ai-book-excerpt/,,,,,,,,
5/9/2023 8:00,You Trained the Chatbot to Do You Job. Why Didn’t You Get Paid?,"IN 2020, 5,000 customer service agents mostly based in the Philippines became guinea pigs in an experiment testing a question that by 2023 would feel urgent: Can an AI assistant based on OpenAI’s text-generation technology make workers more productive?

The automated helper offered agents suggested responses to small-business owners seeking tech support. The bot had been trained on previous customer chats, with a special emphasis on answers from top performers. And sure enough, when MIT and Stanford researchers analyzed the results, the AI tool had boosted the support team’s productivity by 14 percent.

When the National Bureau for Economic Research, a nonprofit, published those results in late April, they were quickly seized upon as confirmation that ChatGPT-style bots would indeed transform work. But for the researchers conducting the study, the results raised a provocative new question: Should the top workers whose chats trained the bot be compensated?

“Let’s imagine you called me with a problem, and I solved it,” says Danielle Li, an economist at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who coauthored the study with MIT PhD candidate Lindsey Raymond and Erik Brynjolfsson, director Stanford’s Digital Economy Lab. In a world without AI chatbots, that would create what economists call productivity. But in the ChatGPT era it also produces valuable data. “Now that data can be used to solve other people's problems, so the same answer has generated more output,” Li says. “And I think it's really important to find a way to measure and compensate that.”

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Raymond argues that it would be in an employer’s interest to find a way to reward workers whose data enables productivity-boosting AI systems. After all, employers will need sharp minds to stick around and continue feeding the model. “There's almost no business situation where there are no new problems. So you need those high performers to continue generating those best practices in the future.”

The question of whether workers should be compensated when their data helps train an AI system to do their job is the latest example of concerns about the way generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or image generators like Dall-E are created. The words or images needed to train these systems were crafted by people who can stand to lose when the AI system is complete.  Coders and artists have sued AI companies, claiming that their copyrighted work was used without their permission. Reddit and programming site Stack Overflow say they will start charging AI companies for access to their conversational caboodle. But what happens if the company capturing the value of your data is your own employer? And what if the better you are at your job, the more valuable your data becomes?

The MIT and Stanford study shows how similar tensions could arise within companies using generative AI tools—and even between workers. The customer service agents worked for a Fortune 500 enterprise software company that the researchers did not have permission to name. The employees provided chat-based support to US small and medium-size businesses navigating administrative issues like payroll and taxes, work that was stressful and involved frequent interactions with cheesed-off customers, causing high turnover on the support team.",https://www.wired.com/story/should-you-get-paid-for-teaching-a-chatbot-to-do-your-job/,,,,,,,,
5/9/2023 7:00,The Team of Sleuths Quietly Hunting Cyberattack-for-Hire Services,"WHEN THE FBI announced the takedown of 13 cyberattack-for-hire services yesterday, it may have seemed like just another day in law enforcement’s cat-and-mouse game with a criminal industry that has long plagued the internet’s infrastructure, bombarding victims with relentless waves of junk internet traffic to knock them offline. In fact, it was the latest win for a discreet group of detectives that has quietly worked behind the scenes for nearly a decade with the goal of ending that plague for good.

Yesterday’s operation was just the most recent of three major cybercriminal takedowns in the past five years that all began inside an informal working group that calls itself Big Pipes. The team’s roughly 30 members, who communicate mostly through Slack and weekly video calls, include staffers from several of the internet’s biggest cloud service providers and online gaming companies—though members from those companies spoke to WIRED on the condition that their employers not be named—as well as security researchers, academics, and a small number of FBI agents and federal prosecutors.

Big Pipes’ detectives have for years methodically tracked, measured, and ranked the output of “booter” or “stresser” services that sell distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks that allow their customers to barrage enemies’ servers with disruptive floods of data. They’ve hunted the operators of those services, with private-sector members of the group often digging up leads that they hand to the group’s law enforcement agents and prosecutors. Together, they worked to initiate a takedown operation in December 2018 that led to the arrest of three hackers and knocked a dozen booter services offline. Last December, their work laid the foundation for Operation Power Off, which led to six arrests and the takedown of no fewer than 49 DDOS-for-hire sites, the biggest bust of its kind.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Yesterday’s takedowns, just four months after Operation Power Off, suggest the operations resulting from the group’s work may be accelerating. And Big Pipes is still tracking and hunting the booters that remain online, warns Richard Clayton, who leads a security research team at Cambridge University and has served as one of the group’s longest-running members. “We’re hoping that some of the people who were not taken down in this round get the message that perhaps it’s time they retired,” says Clayton. “If you weren’t seized this time, you might conclude you’ve pushed up your chance of being investigated. You might not want to wait and see what happens.”

Big Pipes Start Fights

The idea for Big Pipes was sparked at the Slam Spam conference in Pittsburgh in 2014, when Allison Nixon, a security researcher then at Deloitte, met with Elliot Peterson, an FBI agent who’d recently worked on the takedown of the notorious Game Over Zeus botnet. Nixon suggested to Peterson that they collaborate to take on the growing problem of booter services: At the time—and still today—hackers were wreaking havoc by launching ever-growing DDOS attacks across the internet for nihilistic fun, petty revenge, and profit, increasingly selling their attacks as a service.

In some cases, attackers would use botnets of thousands of computers infected with malware. In others, they’d use “reflection” or “amplification” attacks, exploiting servers run by legitimate online services that could be tricked into sending large amounts of traffic to an IP address of the hackers’ choosing. In many instances, gamers would pay a fee to one of a growing number of booter services—often just around $20 for a subscription offering multiple attacks—to hit their rivals’ home connections. Those DDOS techniques frequently caused serious collateral damage for the internet service providers dealing with those indiscriminate floods of traffic. In some cases, DDOS attacks aimed at a single target could take down entire neighborhoods’ internet connections; disrupt emergency services; or, in one particularly gruesome case, break automated systems at a chicken farm, killing thousands of birds.

Big Pipes soon began to recruit staff from major internet services who had firsthand knowledge of booters based on their experiences as both victims and defenders in their attacks. (The group got its name from the phrase “big pipes start fights,” a joke about its members bragging about who among them had the biggest bandwidth on the internet.) Nixon and Clayton, for their part, contributed data from sensor networks they’d created—honeypots designed to join hackers’ botnets or act as their reflection servers and thus allow the researchers to see what attack commands the hackers were sending.",https://www.wired.com/story/big-pipes-ddos-for-hire-fbi/,,,,,,,,
5/9/2023 7:00,The Far North Is Burning—and Turning Up the Heat on the Planet,"THE FAR NORTH is both a massive carbon sink and a potent environmental time bomb. The region stores a huge amount of CO2 in boreal forests and underlying soils. Organic peat soil, for instance, covers just 3 percent of the Earth’s land area (there’s some in tropical regions too), yet it contains a third of its terrestrial carbon. And Arctic permafrost has locked away thousands of years’ worth of plant matter, preventing rot that would release clouds of planet-heating carbon dioxide and methane. 

But in a pair of recent papers, scientists have found that wildfires and human meddling are reducing northern ecosystems’ ability to sequester carbon, threatening to turn them into carbon sources. That will in turn accelerate climate change, which is already warming the Arctic four and a half times faster than the rest of the world, triggering the release of still more carbon—a gnarly feedback loop. 

In fact, over 100 wildfires are burning across Alberta, Canada, right now, forcing nearly 30,000 people from their homes—an “unprecedented situation” in the region. The annual area burned in Canada has doubled since the 1970s, says Mike Flannigan, a fire scientist at Thompson Rivers University. (He wasn't involved in either of the new studies.) “A warmer world means more fire,” he says. “As the temperature warms, the atmosphere gets very efficient at sucking moisture out of dead fuels. So it means more fuels available to burn, which leads to high-intensity fires, which are difficult to impossible to extinguish.”

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Northern boreal forests are the largest land biomes on the planet. When they burn, they release greenhouse gases from both vegetation and carbon-rich soils, which the first new paper, released in March, quantified. In fact, burning boreal forests spew between 10 and 20 times more carbon than fires in other ecosystems. Typically, the blazes account for 10 percent of global fire CO2 emissions annually, but they contributed 23 percent in 2021, thanks to severe heat waves and drought. 

“We are facing a dangerous positive feedback between climate and boreal fires,” says lead author Bo Zheng of China’s Tsinghua University. “The slow recovery of soil microbial communities in forests after extreme wildfires weakens carbon sinks, and makes it difficult for them to fully absorb the large amount of carbon dioxide released during combustion.” That, Zheng adds, “will increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and promote global warming, further increasing the likelihood of extreme wildfires.”

Zheng’s team found that the geographic range of boreal fires has been expanding since 2000—and that alarms Carly Phillips, a research scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists who studies these fires but wasn’t involved in the paper. “Given the carbon density in those ecosystems, that translates to a lot of emissions,"" she says.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-far-north-is-burning-and-turning-up-the-heat-on-the-planet/,,,,,,,,
5/9/2023 7:00,The End of the Covid Emergency Is a Warning,"THE EMERGENCY STAGE of Covid-19 is over—at least in official terms. The World Health Organization declared an end to the Covid global health emergency last week, and the US will end its federal public health emergency for Covid on Thursday. These announcements come a full year after the European Union moved to end its emergency declaration. 

As global and national officials roll back the widespread data tracking, cross-government coordination, and testing programs that were quintessential to the emergency phase of the pandemic, the move raises questions about what was learned from this three-year fight, as well as the vulnerabilities that could be exposed if a new, severe Covid variant—or an entirely new pathogen—emerges. 

“A really big worry is that we haven’t really learned enough from this very traumatic, prolonged disaster that was global in scope,” says Josh Michaud, an associate director for global health policy at the KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research group. Many serious problems persisted throughout the pandemic, like lack of funding for pandemic responses, inequitable distribution of tests and vaccines, and poor public messaging. “If we don’t fix those institutions, those processes, there’s every reason to believe we’d go down a similar road in a future pandemic,” he says.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

In the US, new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are all trending downward, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s also true of cases and deaths in the EU. But when the US ends its emergency on May 11, the CDC will stop tracking community levels of transmission and instead will track overall hospitalization and death rates. The emergency declaration mandated that local data be provided, and that will now lapse.

And with less data, it will be harder to track new variants, which in turn will complicate the puzzle of updating vaccines to provide the most protection, although in some areas wastewater surveillance and genomic surveillance will continue. Should new variants begin circulating and bring Covid-19 roaring back in the fall, there will be less data available. At-home testing has always left gaps in national statistics and viral genetic sequencing efforts, says Peter Hotez, codirector of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. But now, he says, “we’re flying blind.” 

The shift will also make it more challenging for public health officials to convey how serious a risk a future variant could be. “The messaging around ‘it’s over, we’ve won’ is setting us up for a huge betrayal of trust if there is another variant that shows up,” says Sam Scarpino, a professor of health sciences and computer science at Northeastern University.

5/9/2023 7:00,"What to Expect at Google I/O 2023, and How to Watch It","TO BE IN California this May is to bear witness to many spectacles. Our wildflower super blooms, our brag-worthy snowpack, our endless parade of developer conferences from all the big tech companies.

Typically, Google is the one to get developer conference season rolling. The company’s annual I/O conference kicks off this Wednesday morning with a keynote address. Like last year, the developer sessions will be held online instead of in person. But unlike last year, Google will deliver the keynote to a crowd of thousands—a mix of employees, partners, industry analysts, and media—at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California, just a short driverless car ride from the company’s headquarters. WIRED will have a few reporters in attendance; the rest of us will be watching on a livestream, and you can watch at home too.

I/O is technically an event where software programmers attend sessions and learn how to build apps for Google’s platforms. But the company also uses the first day’s keynote address to announce new hardware, software, and services to the public.

Lots of hardware news has already leaked—some of it by rumor-watchers, some of it by Google itself—so we have a decent idea of what’s going to be announced. As always, we should also prepare for a few surprises.

Google likes to debut the newest iteration of its Pixel phones at I/O. We know for sure that the company’s first folding handset, the Pixel Fold, will be fully unveiled on Wednesday. The device was teased by Google last week, and we’re eager to see both how the hardware works and what optimizations have been made to improve Android’s performance on the folding screen. We’re also expecting to see the more budget-conscious Pixel 7A; the low-priced Pixel models traditionally make their entrance during I/O keynotes. We are also anticipating the arrival of a Pixel tablet that shows off the newest ways Android has been optimized for larger screens.

The Matter standard, which promises interoperability between smart home devices, has launched recently, and we should get updates on how the ecosystem of compatible gadgets is growing. 

We can of course expect machine intelligence to play a starring role in this year’s I/O keynote. A large portion of the presentation is bound to be dedicated to Google’s LaMDA and Bard conversational and generative AI technologies, with some demonstrations of how the company has incorporated those elements into search, messaging, and other services. Also at I/O, we traditionally get an update on the latest version of Android and a preview of new features coming to Google apps like Photos, Maps, and Workspace.

How to Watch

The keynote event starts Wednesday, May 10 at 1 pm Eastern, 10 am Pacific. Expect the presentation to last about two hours. You can stream it right here on this page, or at the I/O website if you feel like Google’s just not getting enough web traffic these days. You can also watch live on Google’s YouTube page. (There’s a stream in American Sign Language too.) 

Check back on WIRED.com during and after the event for all sorts of nerdy analysis about what’s been announced and what it all means. We’ll be running a liveblog and rounding up all the news from the show.

If you want a peek into the I/O developer experience, you can sign up to attend the software sessions. Like last year, attendance is free, though you will need to make an account to gain access to the technical plenary. Wednesday’s main keynote will be immediately followed by a developer keynote.",https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-2023-how-to-watch-what-to-expect/,,,,,,,,
,Reality TV Saved Me,"ONE THING I was never told about reality TV—and I’m willing to bet you weren’t either—is that it can heal. Nobody tells you it’s a curative medium. What they do tell you about reality TV is everything else: how it’s reductive and superficial, how it’s cultural rot. It’s a circus, they shout. It microwaves the mind to mush.

It’s also the most dominant form of entertainment today. Reality TV has been called a “volume business”; many of us swallow whole seasons in a single sitting. The shows are operatic, polarizing, and unrepentant about what they are—all id and impulse. Name a setup, pastime, premise, gimmick, and it probably exists as a reality TV show.

We refuse to look away. Or maybe it’s that we can't. Perhaps it’s because we’re addicted to spectacle. Or because we demand our pop culture in every color, shape, and size. Everything is primed for content-making. No, seriously—everything. Across Instagram and TikTok and YouTube, we optimize our lives for the screen. We enjoy letting other people into our curated worlds and being let into theirs in return. It’s OK to admit it: You are good and truly hooked.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

So am I. In the best of times, I watch a fair amount of reality TV. But it was only during this past year—one shot through with heartache, a breakup, and what felt like piled-up grief—that I came to depend on it. In a genre built on stock phrases and digestible tropes, let me offer one more: Reality TV saved me.

LAST SPRING, I grieved for a lost friend. By August, I grieved for my grandmother who was here and then suddenly wasn't. Weeks after that, I grieved for my relationship with T, one that had cratered right in front of me, one that I'd felt—finally—might not end in what-ifs, or end exactly as it did: with a lingering unanswered voice note. I felt like a bodiless thing outside myself.

Depression rose like a tidal wave, and then pulled me under. I went from working out six days a week to one, if that. Writing, which had always sustained me, felt like a chore. My diet was all over the place. I moved through the day with hesitancy. Present time was bad enough, but what intensified anxiety was the time ahead and unplanned, the tyranny of the minutes that were to come.

In all of this, what emerged was a feeling of inauthenticity. It wasn't as though I felt like a fraud or an imposter, the cheeky buzzwords people of my generation like to fling around. I just wasn't sure how to make it through the sadness this time. I was stuck on replay. I spoke to a professional but kept it a secret from almost everyone I knew. I wasn't ashamed. I just didn't feel like talking about it.

And then I did what I always do: I turned to TV. TV was easy. TV was a constant, a plane with the “ability to transmit and receive and then to apply layers of affection and longing and doubt,” as the media critic George W. S. Trow wrote in 1981.",https://www.wired.com/story/reality-tv-saved-me/,,,,,,,,
5/9/2023 2:00,How To Delete Your Data From ChatGPT,"THERE’S A CHANCE that ChatGPT knows personal details about you—and if it doesn’t, it might just make something up. As OpenAI’s generative text chatbot has boomed in popularity over the past six months, the risks of the system being trained on data vacuumed up from the web have become clearer.

Data regulators around the world are investigating issues with how OpenAI gathered the data it uses to train its large language models, the accuracy of answers it provides about people, and other legal concerns about the use of its generative text systems. Europe’s data regulators have joined forces to look at OpenAI after Italy temporarily banned ChatGPT from the country. And Canada is also investigating the technology’s potential privacy risks.

In Europe, GDPR laws require companies and organizations to demonstrate lawful reasons for handling people’s personal information and to let people access information about them, be informed of how their information is used, and demand that errors be rectified. In some cases, they can ask that certain types of data be erased. The way people’s personal information has been used in training data has been an early area of concern for EU regulators.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

As people have experimented with the chatbot, asking it questions about their lives and friends, a range of potential problems have emerged. OpenAI warns that ChatGPT may provide inaccurate information, and people have found that it makes up jobs and hobbies. It has cooked up false newspaper articles that had even the alleged human authors wondering if they were real. It generated incorrect statements saying a law professor was involved in a sexual harassment scandal, and it said a mayor in Australia had been implicated in a bribery scandal—he is preparing to sue for defamation.

It’s not just individuals who are concerned about how data is used. Samsung has banned employees from using generative AI tools, in part over fears about how data is stored on external servers and the risk that company secrets could ultimately be disclosed to other users. (There are separate issues around copyright and intellectual property.)

In response to the scrutiny—particularly from the Italian data regulator, which has now allowed ChatGPT back into the country after OpenAI made changes to its service—the company has introduced tools and processes that allow people more control over at least some of their data. Here’s how to use them.

Get Your Data Removed From ChatGPT

ChatGPT and GPT-4 generate their human-like answers statistically—predicting which words are likely to follow others after seeing millions of examples of sentences written by human authors. OpenAI has been secretive about the data it has trained its large language models on, so nobody outside the company knows exactly how much of the web (including people’s personal information) it has scraped in the process.

OpenAI says its large language models are trained on three sources of information: data taken from the web, data that the company licenses from others, and the information people feed it through chats. This can include information about individuals. “A large amount of data on the internet relates to people, so our training information does incidentally include personal information,” OpenAI explains in a post, stating that it takes steps to reduce the amount it gathers.",https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-delete-your-data-from-chatgpt/,,,,,,,,

,What Really Made Geoffrey Hinton Into an AI Doomer,"GEOFFREY HINTON, PERHAPS the most important person in the recent history of artificial intelligence, recently sent me a video of Snoop Dogg. 

In the clip of a discussion panel, the rapper expresses profane amazement at how artificial intelligence software, such as ChatGPT, can now hold a coherent and meaningful conversation. 

“Then I heard the old dude that created AI saying, ‘This is not safe ’cause the AIs got their own mind and these motherfuckers gonna start doing their own shit,’” Snoop says. “And I’m like, ‘Is we in a fucking movie right now or what?’” 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

The “old dude” is, of course, Hinton. He didn’t create AI exactly, but has played a major role in developing the artificial neural network foundations of today’s most powerful AI programs, including ChatGPT, the chatbot that has sparked widespread debate about how rapidly machine intelligence is progressing.

“Snoop gets it,” Hinton tells me over Zoom from his home in London. The researcher recently left Google so that he could more freely call attention to the risks posed by intelligent machines. Hinton says AI is advancing more quickly than he and other experts expected, meaning there is an urgent need to ensure that humanity can contain and manage it. He is most concerned about near-term risks such as more sophisticated, AI-generated disinformation campaigns, but he also believes the long-term problems could be so serious that we need to start worrying about them now.

When asked what triggered his newfound alarm about the technology he has spent his life working on, Hinton points to two recent flashes of insight. 

One was a revelatory interaction with a powerful new AI system—in his case, Google’s AI language model PaLM, which is similar to the model behind ChatGPT, and which the company made accessible via an API in March. A few months ago, Hinton says he asked the model to explain a joke that he had just made up—he doesn’t recall the specific quip—and was astonished to get a response that clearly explained what made it funny. “I’d been telling people for years that it's gonna be a long time before AI can tell you why jokes are funny,” he says. “It was a kind of litmus test.”

Hinton’s second sobering realization was that his previous belief that software needed to become much more complex—akin to the human brain—to become significantly more capable was probably wrong. PaLM is a large program, but its complexity pales in comparison to the brain’s, and yet it could perform the kind of reasoning that humans take a lifetime to attain. 

Hinton concluded that as AI algorithms become larger, they might outstrip their human creators within a few years. “I used to think it would be 30 to 50 years from now,” he says. “Now I think it's more likely to be five to 20.”

Hinton isn’t the only person to have been shaken by the new capabilities that large language models such as PaLM or GPT-4 have begun demonstrating. Last month, a number of prominent AI researchers and others signed an open letter calling for a pause on the development of anything more powerful than currently exists. But since leaving Google, Hinton feels his views on whether the development of AI should continue have been misconstrued. ",https://www.wired.com/story/geoffrey-hinton-ai-chatgpt-dangers/,,,,,,,,
5/8/2023 9:00,Running Sucks. Kettlebells Are the Answer,"THE OLD ADAGE ""Use your body or you'll lose it"" becomes increasingly true as I age. But what's also true is that the older I get, the harder it is to find an activity I'll enjoy. 

I hate running. If I am running, it's because I'm being chased. Or I am chasing something. Neither of those scenarios come up much, though. Every now and then, I might run on a trail to get to a particular location by sunrise, or to track a bird through the woods. But running for fun? There is no fun in running. Have you ever watched someone running? Do they look like they're having fun? (Ed. note: I am having fun, though, Scott!) No, they look miserable. Because they are. 

I hate running so much that back in high school, when told I had to choose a sport, I picked rowing because it seemed unlikely to involve any running. I was right, mostly. Rowing turned out to be its own special kind of physical hell far worse than running, but at least it wasn't running. I don't mind enduring hell, so long as it isn't running.

What to do? I'd go back to rowing, but boats are expensive and hard to transport when you live in an RV. I like to lift heavy things, but weights are also out for those us in RVs or apartments. I know what you're thinking: Go to the gym, you moron. I hate gyms. I might hate gyms more than running. It's a toss-up.

Theoretical Physicist Explains Time in 5 Levels of Difficulty

For years I got by with push-ups and sit-ups, and pull-ups whenever there was an opportune tree nearby. It worked, mostly. A little lacking in cardio perhaps, but I'm not trying to win a marathon. I just want to age with a modicum of grace. Then I discovered GoRuck's Sand Kettlebells.

Now I can lift heavy things and pack them away in a tiny bundle when I'm done. I also get what I've heard described (accurately) as a stealth cardio workout. GoRuck Sand Kettlebells hit the sweet spot between price, size, and efficacy.

I should probably note here that my idea of a workout is very simple: work as many muscles as you can with the minimum number of exercises. After a bit of experimenting, I found what I've been looking for ever since I stopped rowing, which is a brutally hard workout that doesn't take hours. The kettlebell swing combined with the Turkish get-up give me a very well-rounded workout (I still do push-ups and pull-ups as well).

I've never really liked sand weights. They tend to be poorly made. But GoRuck's Sand Kettlebells are an exception to this rule. They're well made and incredibly durable. They're made of heavy-duty (1000D) Cordura nylon and use a zipper system with a Velcro flap that rolls down like a dry bag to make sure no sand leaks out. In months of testing, I have yet to see any sand leak out. Oh, and if you don't happen to live near any free sand, you can always grab a bag of play sand from your nearest hardware store.",https://www.wired.com/story/goruck-sand-kettlebell-rave/,,,,,,,,
5/8/2023 8:00,Everyone Was Wrong About Reverse Osmosis—Until Now,"MENACHEM ELIMELECH NEVER made peace with reverse osmosis. Elimelech, who founded Yale’s environmental engineering program, is something of a rock star among those who develop filtration systems that turn seawater or wastewater into clean drinking water. And reverse osmosis is a rock star among filter technologies: It has dominated how the world desalinates seawater for about a quarter of a century. Yet nobody really knew how it worked. And Elimelech hated that.

Still, he had to teach the technology to his students. For many years, he showed them how to estimate the high pressures that push the water molecules in seawater across a plastic polyamide membrane, creating pure water on one side of the film and leaving an extra-salty brine on the other. But these calculations relied on an assumption that nagged Elimelech and other engineers: that water molecules diffuse through the membrane individually. “This always bothered me. It does not make any sense,” he says.

This might seem like an arcane engineering question, but Elimelech’s beef with reverse osmosis is based on a real-world problem. Over 3 billion people live in areas where water is scarce. By the year 2030, demand is set to outstrip supply by 40 percent.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

And transforming water from salty seas into something potable has always been energy intensive. Older thermal desalination plants in the Gulf States—where energy is plentiful—distill seawater by boiling it and capturing the vapor. A newer generation of reverse osmosis desalination plants, which run the water through an array of plastic membranes, have cut the energy demand a little, but it’s not enough. It still takes a lot of power to push water through dense filters, so even minor improvements in membrane design go a long way.

In a study published in April, Elimelech’s team proved that the once-frustrating assumption about how water moves through a membrane is, indeed, wrong. They replace it with a “solution-friction” theory that water molecules travel in clusters through tiny, transient pores within the polymer, which exert friction on them as they pass through. The physics of that friction matter, because understanding it could help people design membrane materials or structures that make desalination more efficient or better at screening out undesirable chemicals, Elimelech says.

More effective membranes could also improve municipal water systems and expand the reach of desalination. “This is one of those major breakthroughs,” says Steve Duranceau, an environmental engineer at the University of Central Florida, who spent 15 years designing desalination plants before becoming a professor. “This will change the way that people start modeling, and interpreting how to design these systems.”",https://www.wired.com/story/everyone-was-wrong-about-reverse-osmosis-until-now/,,,,,,,,
,Voyager 2 Gets a Life-Extending Power Boost in Deep Space,"NASA ENGINEERS HAVE come up with a power-saving strategy to eke more time—and more science—out of the Voyager probes, humanity’s longest-running spacecraft, as they continue venturing into unexplored reaches of interstellar space.

And time is of the essence: Voyager 1 and 2 have been flying since 1977, and their power sources have been gradually fading, putting their instruments at risk. Out in the vast abyss of deep space, unfathomably far from our sun, solar power isn’t viable. That’s why engineers equipped each Voyager with a trio of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, or RTGs. These work by converting the heat from the decay of radioisotope fuel, plutonium-238, into electricity. They’re basically nuclear batteries—and they’re finally running out of juice, losing a predictable 4 watts per year. While the Voyagers don’t need that power for propulsion, it’s essential to their ability to collect scientific readings of far-flung charged particles and magnetic fields—so far, humanity’s only opportunity to sample that data in interstellar space.

A couple of years ago, NASA began exploring ways to keep the Voyagers’ instruments running as long as possible. The first move, in 2019, was to start turning off the heaters for the science instruments. That worked; the devices kept working despite temperatures dropping some 50 degrees Celsius, much colder than the conditions they’d been tested in. But it still wasn’t enough, so at the end of March, a NASA team initiated an energy-saving strategy on Voyager 2 that dips into some reserve power meant to protect systems from voltage spikes.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

While this strategy does leave the craft more vulnerable, the risk of such spikes seems to be very low, says Suzanne Dodd, the Voyager project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Assuming all goes well, they’ll start similar voltage management on Voyager 1 as early as this fall. Altogether, Dodd thinks this could buy the probes’ science mission a few extra years. Voyager is still a mission of discovery, she says, and every piece of data the spacecraft obtain in interstellar space is valuable. “I continue to be amazed by these spacecraft and by the engineers who come up with clever ways to operate them,” says Dodd.

Now 45 years old, the Voyagers spent their first two decades flying through the solar system, snapping photos of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune as they zoomed by. Voyager 1 also captured the iconic “pale blue dot” photograph of a tiny, distant Earth. As they kept going, they continued capturing data. They have long outlived their predecessors, Pioneer 10 and 11, which were the first probes to fly by the gas giants but shut down more than 20 years ago. Both Voyagers have flown well beyond the Kuiper belt, a region hosting Pluto and other small, icy bodies. In 2012, Voyager 1 left the heliosphere, the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields generated by the sun, beyond which lies the interstellar medium. Its twin followed six years later, at which point both were officially in interstellar territory, cruising at 35,000 miles per hour into the unknown.

Today, Voyager 1 is 159 astronomical units from home, and Voyager 2 is at 133 AU, traveling in a different direction. (1 AU is the distance between the Earth and sun, or about 93 million miles.) The spacecraft are surely showing signs of age—the team dealt with telemetry problems on Voyager 1 last year—but the cosmic workhorses are continuing on.",https://www.wired.com/story/voyager-2-gets-a-life-extending-power-boost-in-deep-space/,,,,,,,,

When WGA members began their picket on May 2, the first such strike in 15 years, focus was on streaming services’ impact on Hollywood and how the residuals paid to writers for streaming projects hadn’t kept pace with those of traditional broadcast shows and theatrical releases. But there was another demand: that the agreement with studios “regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence or similar technologies.”

FEATURED VIDEO

 

The Writers Guild isn’t alone in trying to figure out AI’s place in its industry. Artists, actors, musicians—people in all creative professions—are trying to wrest control of the technology before it is used against them. It’s a smart move. If the history of automation has demonstrated anything, it’s that leaving the implementation of new technologies up to management is a bad idea.

Over the phone, John August, a member of the WGA’s negotiating committee and writer of Charlie's Angels, explains that the proposal “says that material generated by AI or similar technologies is not considered literary material or source material for the purposes of the contract.” In this context, literary material refers to the stuff writers get paid to write: screenplays, treatments, outlines. Provisions over source material, on the other hand, seek to ensure that writers will not be asked to adapt AI-generated scripts—trained on human writers’ work—as they might with a novel. In both of those scenarios, writers’ employment and pay shrinks. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers rejected this proposal, offering “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.”

With emerging tech, things rarely happen as advertised. This is particularly germane to LLMs, where the scope of possible ends still ranges from flash-in-the-pan productivity tools to society-upending sci-fi intelligence. Skeptics often bring up self-driving cars, baptized in hype a decade ago but still not flooding the roads or outmoding truck drivers.

Nonetheless, generative AI’s current trajectory conjures inescapable parallels with the encroachment of streaming services on the Hollywood system. August recalls that at the time of the 2007 WGA strike, the major streaming services hadn’t yet taken off. He had, however, begun to notice the stirrings of deep sea change, portended by innovations like spin-off “webisodes” of The Office being thrown onto the internet.

“We saw that this might be the next way that companies would be able to make money off of our work,” he says. “So that strike was largely about making sure that, no matter what the medium was, our content still was paid for upfront in a fair way and paid for in the back end through residuals. We didn’t know what streaming was going to become. But we knew the internet was going to be the future.”",https://www.wired.com/story/hollywood-screenwriters-artificial-intelligence-guardrails/,,,,,,,,
5/8/2023 6:00,Data Broker That Targeted Abortion Clinics Gets Military Contract,"THE DATA BROKER made famous for selling location data related to abortion clinic visits has signed a contract with the US Air Force and plans to provide information about “sensitive places” and “adversary state-owned enterprises” around the world, according to records obtained by WIRED. The company, SafeGraph, told the military that its data can be used for “analyzing human activity for landing zone selection,” as well as to identify hospitals, schools, and houses of worship to “help avoid collateral damage.”

As part of a $74,888 “Phase 1” contract with AFWERX, the “innovation wing” of the Air Force, SafeGraph discussed its products with multiple Air Force end-users between November 2022 and February 2023. At the end of the contract, SafeGraph told officials that it had identified several potential customers and planned to adapt its products for larger military partnerships later this year.

SafeGraph did not respond to multiple requests to comment.

In a Google form submitted to the Air Force after its Phase 1 contract ended on February 12, 2023, SafeGraph submitted a slide deck, a one-page marketing pitch, and answers to a series of questions about its experience and plans for future work with the US Department of Defense. The records primarily describe the military needs SafeGraph hopes to fill.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

The thrust of the slide deck is SafeGraph’s ability to provide data about the affiliation of, and activity around, physical locations across the globe. And SafeGraph appears to believe its data is suitable for use in the Air Force’s most high-stakes decisions. On one slide, titled “Defense Need—Identify Sensitive Places to Avoid,” the company explains that its data can “help avoid collateral damage” by identifying hospitals, schools, embassies, and houses of worship. Another record claims it can “Build a No-Strike List at Machine Speed.”

Air strikes on “sensitive places” and civilians have happened repeatedly during US military action in the 21st century. In 2015, US air strikes accidentally destroyed a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, killing more than 40 people; a 2021 drone attack in Kabul killed 10 civilians, including seven children, and was called a “tragic mistake” by US officials. A trove of Pentagon documents assessing the thousands of civilians killed by US bombing in the Middle East point to faulty intelligence and breakdowns in surveillance. Now, SafeGraph is proposing that its location data, historically intended for marketers and hedge funds, can help limit that kind of catastrophic collateral damage.",https://www.wired.com/story/safegraph-us-air-force-location-data/,,,,,,,,

Every time I test an Asus router, I am impressed by the wealth of options and the inclusion of things like robust network security and comprehensive parental controls without a subscription. You can even set up and use the Asus RT-AXE7800 without creating a user account with Asus.

Connectivity is generous and highly configurable. The main WAN/LAN port is rated at 2.5 Gbps, there’s a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three 1-Gbps ports, with support for link aggregation (combining ports for faster wired connections). There’s also a single USB 3.0 port.

If you like to tinker, Asus offers a wealth of options in the mobile app and via the browser interface. You can split bands, set up priority activities (gaming, streaming, working) with the adaptive QoS, and create a mesh network with other AiMesh Asus routers. There’s also support for VPN services, Dynamic DNS, router settings backup, traffic analysis, and all sorts of network tools. Most folks won’t need to fiddle with these settings, but it’s better to have the option.

The discussions have, Nechita says, been “long and tedious.” First there were debates about how to define AI—what it was that Europe was even regulating. “That was a very, very, very long discussion,” Nechita says. Then there was a split over what uses of AI were so dangerous they should be banned or categorized as high-risk. “We had an ideological divide between those who would want almost everything to be considered high-risk and those who would prefer to keep the list as small and precise as possible.”

But those often tense negotiations mean that the European Parliament is getting closer to a sweeping political agreement that would outline the body’s vision for regulating AI. That agreement is likely to include an outright ban on some uses of AI, such as predictive policing, and extra transparency requirements for AI judged to be high-risk, such as systems used in border control.

This is only the start of a long process. Once the members of the European Parliament (MEPs) vote on the agreement later this month, it will need to be negotiated all over again with EU member states. But Europe’s politicians are some of the first in the world to go through the grueling process of writing the rules of the road for AI. Their negotiations offer a glimpse of how politicians everywhere will have to find a balance between protecting their societies from AI’s risks while also trying to reap its rewards. What’s happening in Europe is being closely watched in other countries, as they wrestle with how to shape their own responses to increasingly sophisticated and prevalent AI.

“It’s going to have a spillover effect globally, just as we witnessed with the EU General Data Protection Regulation,” says Brandie Nonnecke, director of the CITRIS Policy Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.

At the core of the debate about regulating AI is the question of whether it's possible to limit the risks it presents to societies without stifling the growth of a technology that many politicians expect to be the engine of the future economy.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-global-battle-to-regulate-ai-is-just-beginning/,,,,,,,,

At this point, Twitter is a game where players compete for the most attention; Twitter Blue is overpowered DLC. If you buy a subscription, your tweets are shown at the top of comment threads and prioritized in other contexts, including the “For You” page. This makes Blue the social media equivalent of paying for unlimited ammo or improved body armor, regardless of who you are or whether what you have to say is worth promoting.

It also makes Twitter really annoying to use. No one wants to play with the people who are paying to win. That's why there's so much mockery of, and desire to avoid, Twitter Blue users.

Granted, there are plenty of reasons why longtime Twitter power users—in particular, public figures or people who historically have trouble with impersonators—might pay for Twitter Blue. No one wants to lose an audience they worked hard to build, and Twitter has the right to monetize itself however it likes. You also have the right to consume (or not consume) the social media you choose.

What Size TV Should You Get?
TCL 6-Series PHOTOGRAPH: TCL

Bigger screens are always better, right? When it comes to TVs, sure, but that doesn't mean you should always spring for the largest size. Pricing on bigger models can get out of hand, and you should always make sure you have room for all that screen footage. 

Under 55 Inches

Some high-end OLED TVs have smaller sizes so they can double as computer monitors, but most TVs below 55 inches are largely nonstandard these days. Many manufacturers still make models below this size, but you likely won't be getting the latest and greatest performance.

55-Inch TVs

This is the smallest standard size for modern TVs. It’s ideal for the average room in a home or apartment, but if you have a larger space, you may want to size up. Be aware that TVs this size and larger often come with feet on both ends of the screen; if you’re not wall-mounting, make sure you measure the width of your TV stand to ensure it can hold your new TV.

65-Inch TVs

This is a good option for larger living rooms or for spaces where you’re going to have many eyes watching at once. If you have the extra cash and space, it is worth the upgrade for those who love seeing details even closer in films and TV shows. 

75 Inches and Above

I only recommend TVs this size and larger for people who have huge rooms and are looking for a truly cinematic experience. Buyer beware: Pricing on TVs this large can get exorbitant (into the tens of thousands for high-end models). Cheaper ones (under $1,000) might not look great due to limitations in processing and panel lighting. Be prepared to have a professional or a group of friends help you move and mount a screen this large.

What Screen Resolution Do You Need?
TCL 8K TV PHOTOGRAPH: TCL

Resolution means the number of pixels on your screen. Modern TVs come in 1080p “Full HD” resolution (1,920 x 1,080 pixels), 4K “UHD” (3,840 x 2,160), and 8K “8K UHD” (7,680 x 4,320) variants. The former and the latter are somewhat rare, but for opposite reasons: Full HD screens are now old tech and are reserved for only the smallest and cheapest offerings; 8K resolution is available mostly on expensive, very large TVs.",https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-buy-the-right-tv/,,,,,,,,
5/7/2023 8:00,A ‘Monumental’ Math Proof Solves the Triple Bubble Problem,"WHEN IT COMES to understanding the shape of bubble clusters, mathematicians have been playing catch-up to our physical intuitions for millennia. Soap bubble clusters in nature often seem to immediately snap into the lowest-energy state, the one that minimizes the total surface area of their walls (including the walls between bubbles). But checking whether soap bubbles are getting this task right—or just predicting what large bubble clusters should look like—is one of the hardest problems in geometry. It took mathematicians until the late 19th century to prove that the sphere is the best single bubble, even though the Greek mathematician Zenodorus had asserted this more than 2,000 years earlier.

Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research develop­ments and trends in mathe­matics and the physical and life sciences.

The bubble problem is simple enough to state: You start with a list of numbers for the volumes, and then ask how to separately enclose those volumes of air using the least surface area. But to solve this problem, mathematicians must consider a wide range of different possible shapes for the bubble walls. And if the assignment is to enclose, say, five volumes, we don’t even have the luxury of limiting our attention to clusters of five bubbles—perhaps the best way to minimize surface area involves splitting one of the volumes across multiple bubbles.

Even in the simpler setting of the two-dimensional plane (where you’re trying to enclose a collection of areas while minimizing the perimeter), no one knows the best way to enclose, say, nine or 10 areas. As the number of bubbles grows, “quickly, you can’t really even get any plausible conjecture,” said Emanuel Milman of the Technion in Haifa, Israel.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

But more than a quarter century ago, John Sullivan, now of the Technical University of Berlin, realized that in certain cases, there is a guiding conjecture to be had. Bubble problems make sense in any dimension, and Sullivan found that as long as the number of volumes you’re trying to enclose is at most one greater than the dimension, there’s a particular way to enclose the volumes that is, in a certain sense, more beautiful than any other—a sort of shadow of a perfectly symmetric bubble cluster on a sphere. This shadow cluster, he conjectured, should be the one that minimizes surface area.

Over the decade that followed, mathematicians wrote a series of groundbreaking papers proving Sullivan’s conjecture when you’re trying to enclose only two volumes. Here, the solution is the familiar double bubble you may have blown in the park on a sunny day, made of two spherical pieces with a flat or spherical wall between them (depending on whether the two bubbles have the same or different volumes).

But proving Sullivan’s conjecture for three volumes, the mathematician Frank Morgan of Williams College speculated in 2007, “could well take another hundred years.”

John Sullivan, shown here in 2008, conjectured 27 years ago that optimal bubble clusters in certain settings are equivalent to the shadows of symmetric bubbles covering a sphere.PHOTOGRAPH: ULRICH DAHL/TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET BERLIN",https://www.wired.com/story/triple-bubble-problem-math-proof/,,,,,,,,
5/7/2023 7:00,Google Is Using AI to Make Hearing Aids More Personalized,"EARLIER THIS YEAR, Cochlear, the manufacturer of cochlear implants, announced a collaboration with Google and Australian Hearing Hub members, the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL), Macquarie University, the Shepherd Centre, and NextSense. The aim is to improve existing hearing-assistance technologies, like hearing aids and cochlear implants, and to develop new solutions for folks experiencing hearing loss.

There's a growing awareness that it's important to protect our hearing. Nevertheless, the world faces a hearing loss crisis. According to the World Health Organization, more than 1.5 billion people worldwide live with hearing loss today (430 million with disabling hearing loss), but it predicts that by 2050, those figures will grow to 2.5 billion and 700 million, respectively. 

By bringing together expertise and resources from across the spectrum of hearing research, technology, academia, government, and health care, this partnership hopes to make real breakthroughs in hearing technologies over the next few years. 

Complete Customization

Although every person with hearing loss is unique, the industry has a one-size-fits-all approach with most hearing aids. Experts and people with hearing loss have long been calling for a more personalized approach. Google hopes to bring its AI and machine learning expertise into play.

“The idea is to be able to customize the experience for each person, and for the environment they are currently in,” explains Sam Sepah, lead accessibility research product manager at Google.

Most people with hearing aids or cochlear implants struggle in noisy environments. While hearing aids amplify the sounds people want to hear, they also amplify background noises. Picking a single voice out of the noise in a busy restaurant or participating in a group meeting can be difficult. It requires a lot of concentration to understand conversations when you only pick up a few of the words spoken, and environments with lots of background noise, like a car or plane cabin, can be unbearable. ",https://www.wired.com/story/cochlear-and-google-hearing-technology-coalition/,,,,,,,,
5/7/2023 7:00,Samsung's Galaxy A54 Is a Well-Rounded Sub-$500 Smartphone,"NOT MUCH HAS changed with Samsung’s Galaxy A54 5G smartphone since its predecessor, the Galaxy A53 5G. That's good because it was already a great midrange phone with quite a lot of top-end features, from a bright AMOLED screen to lengthy software updates. You can also say it's not good, because this new model doesn't push the needle.

And yet it's really hard to complain about the lack of advancements with this Android smartphone. In the US, there's a dearth of feature-packed midrange and budget phones: You'd be amazed at the kind of hardware you can get elsewhere in the world for a few hundred bucks. Still, what Samsung offers here is a compelling, well-rounded package you'll be able to keep using for several years, unlike many other sub-$450 phones that end software support after one to two.

Another A+
PHOTOGRAPH: SAMSUNG

Samsung has been working on creating a cohesive design strategy for all of its smartphones. That means, yes, its $1,000 smartphone doesn't look all that different from its phones less than half the price. This might irk high rollers, but it's great news for anyone with a tight budget! The A54 even comes in a lovely-looking Awesome Violet, though I tested the drab Awesome Graphite color (not as awesome).

It has an aluminum frame with Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back, so you'll want to snag a case, as both sides have the same opportunity to suffer a crack in the event of an accidental drop. Most budget and midrange phones stick with a plasticky backplate, which offers more durability, though you might like the more luxe feel of glass. I prefer something like the Pixel 6A's design, which is a plastic composite that still feels super fancy; the best of both worlds.

Holding this 6.4-inch screen is reasonably comfy. There are times when I need to shuffle it in my hand to reach the top of the screen (note: I have large hands), but I don't have any major complaints. The in-display fingerprint sensor at the bottom of the screen isn't as responsive as what you'll find on pricier phones, but it was never frustratingly slow.

The best part is hands-down the AMOLED screen. This panel nets you inky blacks and punchy colors. The resolution is sharp, but the screen brightness is what impresses the most. It can go up to 1,000 nits! What does that mean? Lo and behold, even the wrath of the sun couldn't stop me from comfortably reading the display. Sure, the colors get a little washed out when it's at its peak brightness, but it's a small price to pay for the pleasure of not having to squint.

Did I mention it's a 120-Hz screen as well? As you scroll through an app like Instagram or Reddit, the frames you see on the screen ratchet up to 120 per second. Phones used to be stuck at 60 Hz, so by seeing double the frames, you're getting a more fluid experience overall. It's nice!",https://www.wired.com/review/samsung-galaxy-a54-5g/,,,,,,,,

5/6/2023 12:39,The Ecovacs Deebot T9+ Leaves Your House Smelling Sweet,"LAST YEAR, I reviewed Ecovacs’ Deebot (6/10, WIRED Review). It was an expensive and massive mopping robot vacuum that came with a ton of extra functions that, to be quite honest, didn’t make much practical sense. My 8-year-old, for example, is used to her mother occasionally doing strange things around the house. She accepted when her mother was talking to her through that robot vacuum’s walkie-talkie, but she didn’t exactly like it.

That’s why, this year, it made more sense for me to try the Deebot T9+, which at $800 is the midrange model in Deebot's 2023 line. There’s also this year’s Deebot N10+ ($650), which is the lower-end model, and the Deebot T10 Omni ($1,200). While the Deebot T9+ does not come with a dock that’s big enough to pass for Snoopy’s doghouse (as the previous one I tested did), it does have an updated navigation system, a new oscillating mop, and—get this—an air freshener.

To be honest, I thought the air freshener would be as useless as the walkie-talkie. But I now react in a way that can only be described as Pavlovian to the automatic air-freshening. The T9+’s subtle, refreshing wafts of cucumber and oak were as soothing as knowing that my floors would be clean before friends came over. If you’re looking for a combination robot vacuum and mop, this is a pretty great pick.

Sticky Floors Begone
PHOTOGRAPH: ECOVACS

The Deebot T9+ looks pretty much the same as any standard robot vacuum, with a white auto-empty tower. It’s about 4 inches tall and comes with a plastic plate to put under the dock to make it easier for the vacuum to roll back onto the charging ports at the end of a cleaning job. I used to think this step wasn’t necessary, especially if your vacuum is on hardwood, but it really is.

The T9+ doesn’t have Yiko, Ecovacs’ proprietary voice assistant that made last year’s Omni so easy to use, but the Ecovacs app is now much easier to navigate. I paired the vacuum and named it “4 Blue Heelers” after the number and types of pets that my kids are bugging me to get. The first run mapped my house accurately and took 85 minutes to clean 850 square feet, with about 10 percent battery left.

We have come a long way since dual vacuum-mop robots just asked you to stick a slightly damp cloth on the bottom to clean the floors. The T9+ is not quite as sophisticated as the T10 Omni, which like last year’s Omni washes the reusable mopping pads with each use and dries them with hot air to prevent bacterial growth and odors.

However, I find its disposable mopping pads to be an order of magnitude easier than other reusable pads that I’ve used. To mop, swap out the bottom bracket for the mopping attachment, fill the tank with water, and stick a disposable cleaning pad on with Velcro. It’s easier to use than the reusable pads on the Shark AI Ultra (8/10, WIRED Recommends); you don’t have to hand-wash cleaning pads in the sink. It’s not great for the Earth, but on days when I’ve had to run the mop consecutively—for example, when my kids made cupcakes that covered the floor in sprinkles, then an hour later made pizzas that covered it in flour—I was really happy that I could swap out cleaning pads instantly.",https://www.wired.com/review/ecovacs-deebot-t9/,,,,,,,,

Russian Ships Identified Near the Nord Stream Blasts

Russian ships with underwater operations equipment have been identified as being near the sites of the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosions in the days before the blasts, according to a joint investigation from national broadcasters in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Journalists at the publications combined intercepted radio broadcasts from the ships with satellite images to pinpoint their locations and track their paths. It is the latest example of investigators piecing together different sources of data, from varying unconnected sources, to reveal new details about real-world events.

Three ships, according to the investigation, sailed from naval bases in Russia to near the blast sites in June and September 2022. All of the ships had turned off their location tracking AIS services, an act often described as “going dark” and commonly used for disguising activity. Among the vessels were the navy research ship Sibiryakov and a tugboat called SB-123, which is said to be capable of launching mini-submarines. (In November 2022, WIRED reported on the presence of “ghost ships” around the time of the explosions, but had no information on their identity.)

Separately, another Russian vessel, the SS-750, was near the pipelines four days before they were blown up. In response to a public records request, the Danish Defense Command confirmed to the Information, a Danish news site, that it had 26 photos of the SS-750 near the sites.",https://www.wired.com/story/russian-ghost-ships-nord-stream-blast/,,,,,,,,
5/6/2023 8:00,"At Last, ‘Ugly’ Sea Lampreys Are Getting Some Respect","THIS STORY ORIGINALLY appeared on Yale Environment 360 and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

“Thousands of sea lamprey are passed upstream [on the Connecticut River] each year. This is a predator that wiped out the Great Lakes lake-trout fishery. [Lampreys] literally suck the life out of their host fish, namely small-scale fish such as trout and salmon. The fish ladders ought to be used to diminish the lamprey.” So editorialized the Eagle-Tribune of Lawrence, Massachusetts, on December 15, 2002.

If that’s true, why this spring is Trout Unlimited—the nation’s leading advocate for trout and salmon—assisting the Town of Wilton, Connecticut, and an environmental group called Save the Sound in a project that will restore 10 miles of sea lamprey spawning habitat on the Norwalk River, which flows into Long Island Sound?

Why this summer will the first big returns from stocked Pacific lampreys—a species similar to sea lampreys—climb specially designed lamprey ramps at Columbia River dams and surge into historical spawning habitat in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho?

And why, when the canal at Turners Falls on the Connecticut River is drawn down in September, will the Connecticut River Conservancy, Fort River Watershed Association, and the Biocitizen environmental school rescue stranded sea lamprey larvae?

The Double Life of an American Lake Monster

BY MARION RENAULT AND MICHAEL TESSLER

The answer is ecological awakening—the gradual realization that, if the whole of nature is good, no part can be bad. In their native habitat, marine lampreys are “keystone species” supporting vast aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They provide food for insects, crayfish, fish, turtles, minks, otters, vultures, herons, loons, ospreys, eagles, and hundreds of other predators and scavengers. Lamprey larvae, embedded in the stream bed, maintain water quality by filter feeding; and they attract spawning adults from the sea by releasing pheromones. Because adults die after spawning, they infuse sterile headwaters with nutrients from the sea. When marine lampreys build their communal nests, they clear silt from the river bottom, providing spawning habitat for countless native fish, especially trout and salmon.

Environmental consultant Stephen Gephard, formerly Connecticut’s anadromous-fish chief, calls lampreys “environmental engineers” as important to native ecosystems as beavers.

Marine lampreys, our elders by some 340 million years, depend on cold, free-flowing freshwater for spawning. They are boneless, jawless, eel-like fish with fleshy fins. They extract body fluids from other fish via tooth-studded suction disks. Both sea lampreys and Pacific lampreys are widely reviled because they are perceived as “ugly” and because sea lampreys decimated indigenous fish in the upper Great Lakes when they gained access to those waters via human-built canals, most likely the Welland Canal that bypassed Niagara Falls. Once there, they nearly wiped out valuable commercial and sport fisheries for lake trout (the largest char species, not a true trout like rainbows, cutthroats, and browns).

By the 1960s, nonnative sea lampreys had reduced the annual commercial take of lake trout in the upper Great Lakes from about 15 million pounds to half a million pounds. In 1955, Canada and the United States established the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, which controls lampreys with barriers, traps, and a remarkably selective larvae poison called TFM. Lamprey control costs $15 to $20 million a year; and without it, ongoing lake-trout recovery would be impossible, and populations of all other sport fish would crash.",https://www.wired.com/story/at-last-ugly-sea-lampreys-are-getting-some-respect/,,,,,,,,

The Cyclone V10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a little bit older, but don't let its age fool you. We loved it in 2018, and it still works just as well. It's light, has a generous dust bin, and can run for up to an hour on a single charge. The Cyclone V10 Animal is a slight step up that's designed for homes with a lot of pet fur to clean up. 

Dyson Ball Animal 2 Upright Vacuum for $380 ($120 off)
AMAZON (PURPLE)
DYSON (SILVER)
WALMART (NICKEL)

Our favorite vacuum for homes with a lot of pet fur to clean up is the Dyson Ball Animal 3, which is currently not on sale. However, our reviewer, Jaina Grey, owned its predecessor for almost two decades before it conked out. The slightly older Ball Animal 2 even has a self-adjusting cleaner head that the 3 lacks, which makes this a great time to buy. 

Dyson Ball Multi Floor Origin Upright Vacuum for $190 ($110 off)
WALMART

If you're more into upright vacuums—or simply want a vacuum on a budget—then we recommend the Origin. When it's on sale, anyway, like right now. It's nearly as powerful as the Ball Animal 2, and it comes with a stair tool and combination brush nozzle. It's not as convenient as a stick vacuum, but when it's on sale, it's a heck of a lot cheaper.

AMAZON (CLICK COUPON)
WALMART

Our top pick for robot vacuum cleaners, the Roborock Q5+ (9/10, WIRED Recommends), is one of the best around. It avoids all the little hassles of most robot vacs, like getting stuck on strings or falling off the stairs. It's the easiest robot vacuum we've tested to just set and ignore.

iRobot Roomba j7+ Robot Vacuum for $600 ($200 off)
AMAZON

This robot vacuum is our absolute top pick, with a couple caveats. First, it's more expensive than our top overall pick, and there are some valid concerns about Amazon's data collection policies. It's also worth noting that this vacuum is frequently available at this price. So it's less that this is a sale, and more that it's often on a long-term anti-sale, but right now it's safe to buy.

Samsung Jet Bot AI+ Robot Vacuum for $614 ($386 off)
AMAZON
SAMSUNG

The Samsung Jet Bot AI+ might be a large, ugly gadget, but it's got brains. In our testing, it had some of the best navigation among all the bots we've tried, even steering around a sleeping 80-pound dog. Normally it's so expensive it's in the four-figure range, but right now it's on a substantial discount.

Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop for $550 ($50 off)
AMAZON

The Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) surprised us after some less-than-stellar previous products from the company. But this model is now our top pick for a vac-mop combo. It uses laser navigation to map your home, and you can designate vacuum and mopping zones. It worked great at both tasks, though you'll need to swap between the vacuum bin and mopping bin in between jobs.

AMAZON

When your pet makes a mess that a vacuum can't clean, this Bissel spot cleaner is our favorite for smaller jobs. It's cordless and portable, so you don't need to lug it around like a balky suitcase. It works great at getting out stains, and it's even easy to clean the device itself.

Shark Wandvac Handheld Vacuum for $100 ($30 off)
AMAZON

Handheld vacuums aren't quite as popular as they used to be, before stick vacuums were invented, but they're still, you know, handy. And the Shark Wandvac is our top pick overall. It's light and small, and it has surprising suction for its size. 

Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler for $480 ($120 off)
BEST BUY

Technically, this might be a hair-styling tool, but it's also part of Dyson's sale, and we like it too much not to include it. The Airwrap Multi-Styler (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is easy to use with one hand, it offers a variety of functions for different hair types, and it uses less heat than many other stylers, so there's less damage to your hair.

5/6/2023 7:00,Japanese Game Studios Are Taking Accessibility to the Next Level,"2023 IS ALREADY a promising year for disabled gamers. From the recent PC release of The Last of Us Part I to Dead Space’s extensive content warnings for individuals with mental health disabilities, accessibility design continues to evolve. And it’s not just Western studios that are innovating. Several titles from Japanese studios are demonstrating a global interest in accessibility in games.

This year alone, games like Wild Hearts and Hi-Fi Rush included dozens of features and design practices that allow disabled people to play with as few unintended barriers as possible. But this attention to accessibility detail is not new. Speaking with WIRED, Wild Hearts co-director Takuto Edagawa and Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas discussed their games’ options, how the studios work with the accessibility community, and the overall importance of creating accessible and entertaining experiences for all.

Omega Force
Wild Hearts COURTESY OF EA

Developed by Omega Force and Koei Tecmo, and published by Electronic Arts, Wild Hearts is the latest iteration in the monster hunting genre. And with the difficult task of slaying gargantuan beasts comes an assortment of accessibility features to aid disabled hunters. Customizing keys, enabling screen readers for menus, and even toggling actions such as the Karakuri Stance help to reduce player exhaustion and extend play periods. These settings are just some of the available tools that Edagawa wants disabled individuals to be able to access.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

“This is not the first time Omega Force has incorporated accessibility features into our games, but I think it's the title which we put the most effort into so far,” Edagawa says. “As it's an action game, complicated controls are often required, so we tried hard to create an environment that's easy to play for a wide variety of players without compromising the gameplay.”

Implementing accessibility is a process that requires continuous learning and listening. As technology and systems evolve, so too do the methods that developers use to create innovative features and designs. Thankfully, development teams can look to other studios and even consultants for inspiration and resources. For Wild Hearts, Edagawa acknowledges the support that EA provided, as well as the importance of looking elsewhere for guidance.

“We weren't inspired by one specific game, but we did refer to various Western AAA games when we decided on the accessibility features, as Western games are really advanced in this field,” he says. “In addition, we received a lot of detailed information on how to implement these features from EA, which was very helpful. EA helped us with deciding which settings needed to be included and checked if the features were working properly. There’s always more that can be done, but their input helped set us on the right path.”",https://www.wired.com/story/japan-game-studios-accessibility/,,,,,,,,
5/6/2023 7:00,"All Hail Charles, the Unmemeable King","MAYBE IT’S THE sourpuss attitude. Maybe it’s the sincerity with which he campaigns for the countryside, rather than just shouting “cows” joyfully when confronted by them. Maybe it’s a general diminishment of interest in British royalty. Maybe it’s the gold state coach and cloak at a time when millions of UK adults are unable to afford essential hygiene products.

But today, as King Charles III is crowned in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London, the response of the internet’s meme-makers will feel muted in comparison to the one enjoyed by his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who was a meme queen we all stanned.

Queen Elizabeth II Has Died. Her Internet Legacy Will Live On

On the face of it, King Charles should be an ideal candidate for memedom. He has unnervingly red, rotund, sausage fingers. He has a cartoonish visage, lampooned for years by cartoonists and eBay sellers, with jug-handle ears and a hangdog, sullen expression. He has an unnerving, innocent, naive approach to life that leads him to say outlandish things, which often come back to bite him. He once, reportedly, shrieked when he first saw plastic wrap.

Charles’ 1989 declaration that he was so infatuated with Camilla, who will become queen this Saturday, that he wanted to be reincarnated as a tampon so he could forever live inside her, has big dril energy.

Yet none of that has cut through to make Charles a perennial internet fave. Even attempts at internet traffic-catching roundups of the best King Charles memes are … underwhelming, and often not really about the man himself.

“He's not publicly weird enough to be endearing, but he’s also not like a patriarch because he's too weird to give off being normal,” says Hussein Kesvani, a journalist and podcaster specializing in digital culture. “When it comes to being popular online, especially cross-audiences, you need to have a malleable weirdness that makes you endearing as a subject or a feature.”

Perhaps the tally of “good-weird” when it comes to evaluating Charles’s suitability for memedom is outweighed by the tally of “bad-weird.” He has always been portrayed as problematic compared to his ex-wife, Princess Diana, who died in a 1997 car crash. He has been willing to intervene in politics in a way that unelected members of the royal family have tried to avoid. He has an unfortunate habit of accepting cash donations in suitcases and grocery bags from Middle Eastern sheikhs.

And perhaps he’s suffering from the problem likely to blight his reign: He spent much of his life playing second fiddle to Queen Elizabeth, living in her shadow and being unable to develop much of a kingly standing of his own in the public’s eyes. “The queen was around for a very long time,” says Jeremy Blackburn, an assistant professor in computer science at Binghamton University and cofounder of the iDRAMA Lab, which looks at memes on the web. “So there was a long history that people had to draw from there.”

While Queen Elizabeth II was seen as a grandmother figure to the world, an innocent, sweet old lady, like Angela Lansbury but with palaces, Charles has long been seen—likely incorrectly—as waiting for his mother to give him his time to shine.",https://www.wired.com/story/coronation-king-charles-iii-memes/,,,,,,,,
5/5/2023 15:39,How to Watch the Coronation of King Charles III Live,"KING CHARLES III officially shed his princedom when Queen Elizabeth II died, and the British royal’s new position will be formalized on May 6 in a coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey. The coronation of Charles’ mother was the first crowning to be broadcast on television.

The Two Popes

At first glance, The Two Popes is not a gripping proposition: a film where two very old men in dresses talk a lot, walk around a little bit, and then talk some more. But two top-notch performances from Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins and a stellar script from Anthony McCarten turn this prosaic premise into a film worth watching. Loosely inspired by true events, it follows Cardinal Bergoglio (now Pope Francis) as he tries to convince Pope Benedict XVI to accept his resignation. The two men couldn't be more different—Benedict is an archconservative desperate to cling to tradition while Bergoglio is seen as a dangerous liberalizer who might erode the Church's authority. While the two men battle out their differences, the future of Catholicism hangs in the balance.

Paddington

Shipped from Peru to London, a young talking bear is found and taken in by the Brown family—much to the delight of children Jonathan and Judy and their mother Mary, but to the chagrin of patriarch Henry Brown. Named Paddington after the train station the Browns found him in, the well-meaning outsider causes chaos as he tries to settle into his new life, while avoiding the maniacal taxidermist Millicent Clyde. While Paddington could have been yet another cloying adaptation of a kids’ lit favorite, director Paul King and his phenomenal cast—including Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Peter Capaldi, Nicole Kidman as Clyde, and Ben Whishaw as the voice of Paddington himself—serve up a cosy family movie with a lot of heart, humor, and hijinks. Twee in places, but sure to put a smile on the face of even the most cynical viewer.

Day Shift

Headed by Jamie Foxx, this horror-action-comedy hybrid juxtaposes the night-bound tropes of the vampire genre against a sun-drenched Los Angeles, with Foxx’s struggling slayer Bud Jablonski stuck on the vampire hunter union’s lower-paying day shift. Overseen by bureaucratic union rep Seth (Dave Franco), the bickering buddy cop vibe gives way to a battle to save Bud’s family from a vampire with ambitions of godhood, as director J.J. Perry shows off the tricks he picked up as stunt coordinator on the John Wick and Fast & Furious franchises. With an awareness of its own ludicrous concept and a willingness to go wildly over the top—Snoop Dogg steals scenes as rotary cannon-wielding veteran slayer Big John—Day Shift delivers some of the most inventive fanger fights committed to film. It’s horror-comedy brain candy, but for a delightfully dumb action flick, this is one of the freshest in years.

For the Love of Spock

Directed by Leonard Nimoy's son Adam Nimoy, this looks at the life and career of the famed Star Trek actor, and the impact his role as the highly logical science officer of the USS Enterprise had on pop culture as a whole. The documentary merges classic on-set and behind-the-scenes footage with interviews from Nimoy's original Trek castmates, later actors and creators influenced by him—including Zachary Quinto, who played a younger Spock in the rebooted movie series—and even personal family photos, for a poignant look at Nimoy’s career. Yet despite having begun life as a Star Trek anniversary project, For the Love of Spock evolves into a celebration of Nimoy's life beyond the bridge of a famous spaceship. It's not just fan service for Star Trek fans—this also examines the sometimes rocky relationship between the elder Nimoy and his son, making for an even more personal and sometimes difficult viewing experience for those who only know of Spock the character, rather than Nimoy the man.

Kill Boksoon

To her friends, Gil Bok-soon (Jeon Do-yeon) is a successful events executive and dedicated single mother to her daughter, Jae-yeong (Kim Si-a). In reality, she’s the star performer at MK Ent—an assassination bureau, where her almost superhuman ability to predict every step in a critical situation has earned her a 100 percent success rate and killer reputation. The only problem: She’s considering retiring at the end of her contract, a decision that opens her to threats from disgruntled enemies and ambitious colleagues alike. While its title and premise not-so-subtly evoke Tarantino's Kill Bill, director Byun Sung-hyun takes this Korean action epic to giddy heights with some of the most impressive fights committed to screen since, well, Kill Bill.

Okja

Before winning Oscars and cementing his name in the Hollywood firmament for Parasite, Bong Joon-ho had something of a sideline in creature features. While 2006’s The Host remains worth hunting down, this 2017 saga of genetic engineering and animal exploitation may be the director’s pinnacle of the genre. After helping raise an enhanced “super pig” in rural South Korea, young Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun) is distraught when the American company behind its creation, Mirando, comes to take it back. Falling in with a group of Animal Liberation Front activists, Mija travels to Mirando’s headquarters in New York in a desperate effort to rescue her unlikely animal friend. Darkly satirical in places, Okja manages to explore themes of animal exploitation and environmental conservation without feeling preachy.

Cargo

In a world already ravaged by a zombie-like plague, Andy Rose (Martin Freeman) only wants to keep his family safe, sticking to Australia’s most rural back roads to avoid infection. After his wife is tragically bitten, and infects him in turn, Andy is desperate to find a safe haven for his infant daughter, Rosie. With a mere 48 hours until he succumbs himself, Andy finds an ally in Thoomi (Simone Landers), an Aboriginal girl looking to protect her own rabid father—but with threats from paranoid survivalists and Aboriginal communities hunting the infected, it may already be too late. A unique twist on the zombie apocalypse, Cargo abandons the familiar urban landscapes of the genre for the breathtaking wilds of Australia, and offers a slower, character-led approach to the end of the world.

Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio

The modern master of the macabre brings the famous wooden would-be boy to life like never before in this exquisitely animated take on Pinocchio. A stop-motion masterpiece that hews closer to the original 1880s tale by Carlo Collodi than the sanitized Disney version, Guillermo del Toro adds his own signature touch and compelling twists to the classic story that make it darkly enchanting—expect a Blue Fairy closer to a biblically accurate many-eyed angel and a Terrible Dogfish more like a kaiju. It’s the decision to transplant the tale to World War II that’s the most affecting though—cast against the rise of fascism, with Gepetto mourning the loss of his son, this is a film packed with complex themes of mortality and morality that will haunt audiences long after the credits roll. If that doesn't sell you, perhaps the fact that it won Best Animated Feature at the 2023 Academy Awards will?

The Land of Steady Habits

Anders Hill (Ben Mendelsohn) thought he wanted a change from his stifling life in a wealthy suburb of Connecticut. Now rashly divorced from Helene (Edie Falco), the woman he still loves, regretting his decision to retire early, and struggling with his adult son Preston’s (Thomas Mann) battles with drug addiction, Anders is spiraling. The Land of Steady Habits could be another typically maudlin look at a rich man’s midlife crisis, but writer and director Nicole Holofcener—adapting Ted Thompson’s novel of the same name—refuses to let its lead off the hook for his own culpability in his downfall, while also infusing Anders’ journey with both dark humor and a strange warmth.

Bigbug

In Bigbug, Jean-Pierre Jeunet—the director of Amélie, Delicatessen, and City of Lost Children—presents a near future where AI and robots are omnipresent, making life smoother and simpler for their organic masters. Unfortunately, humans remain just as messy and complicated as ever. A locked-room drama that would be as comfortable on stage as it is in Jeunet’s heightened unreality, Bigbug follows a group of splintered family members and interfering neighbors, their fractious relationships coming to a boil while trapped in a household security lockdown initiated by domestic helper robots. Meanwhile, the military-industrial Yonyx androids are taking over the outside world—an AI apocalypse drowned out by human neuroses. Any movie from Jeunet is worth a look, and with its satirical flair, exquisite set design, and sharp performances from French cinema royalty, the latest addition to his filmography is no exception.

An idyllic slice-of-life movie with a twist, Call Me Chihiro follows a former sex worker—the eponymous Chihiro, played by Kasumi Arimura—after she moves to a seaside town to work in a bento restaurant. This isn’t a tale of a woman on the run, trying to move on from her past. Chihiro is refreshingly forthright and unapologetic, and her warmth and openness soon begin to change the lives of her neighbors. Directed by Rikiya Imaizumi, this is an intimate, heartfelt character drama that alternates between moments of aching loneliness and sheer joy, packed with emotional beats that remind viewers of the importance of even the smallest connections.

The Sea Beast

It's easy to imagine that the elevator pitch for The Sea Beast was “Moby Dick meets How to Train Your Dragon”—and who wouldn’t be compelled by that? Set in a fantasy world where oceanic leviathans terrorize humanity, those who hunt down the giant monsters are lauded as heroes. Jacob Holland (voiced by Karl Urban) is one such hero, adopted son of the legendary Captain Crowe and well on the way to building his own legacy as a monster hunter—a journey disrupted by stowaway Maisie Brumble (Zaris-Angel Hator), who has her own ambitions to take on the sea beasts. However, after an attempt to destroy the colossal Red Bluster goes disastrously wrong, Jacob and Maisie are stranded on an island filled with the creatures, and they find that the monsters may not be quite so monstrous after all. A rollicking sea-bound adventure directed by Chris Williams—of Big Hero 6 and Moana fame—it has secured its standing as one of Netflix’s finest movies with a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the upcoming Oscars.

Unfortunately, she’s marked as a Hell Maiden on her first day, attracting the attention of actual demon brothers Wendell and Wild (voiced by Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, respectively). Tempted by the scheming siblings’ promise to resurrect her parents if she summons them to the living world—where they plan to out-do their infernal father at his own game—Kat (Lyric Ross) is drawn into a macabre plot that threatens the living and dead alike. Directed by Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline) and produced by Jordan Peele (Nope, Get Out), this is another fantastic entry in Selick’s canon of mesmerizingly dark stop-motion masterpieces.

Troll

This gleefully entertaining giant-monster movie eschews tearing up the likes of New York or Tokyo in favor of director Roar Uthaug’s (Tomb Raider 2018) native Norway, with a titanic troll stomping its way toward Oslo after being roused by a drilling operation. The plot and characters will be familiar to any fan of kaiju cinema—Ine Marie Wilmann heads up the cast as Nora Tidemann, the academic with a curiously specific skill set called in to advise on the crisis, while Kim Falck fits neatly into the role of Andreas Isaksan, the government adviser paired with her, and Gard B. Eidsvold serves as Tobias Tidemann, the former professor chased out of academia for his crazy theories about trolls. But the striking Nordic visuals and the titular menace’s ability to blend in with the landscape allows for some impressively original twists along the way. Although Troll could have easily descended into parody, Uthaug steers clear of smug self-awareness and instead delivers one of the freshest takes on the genre in years.

White Noise

The latest from director Noah Baumbach sees him reteaming with his Marriage Story lead Adam Driver for another quirky look at disintegrating families and interpersonal angst—albeit this time with an apocalyptic twist. Driver stars as Jack Gladney, a college professor faking his way through a subject he’s unable to teach and struggling to work out family life with his fourth wife, Babette (Greta Gerwig), and their four kids from previous relationships. Neurotic familial squabbles prove the least of their worries, though, when an “airborne toxic event” hits their town, sending everyone scrambling for cover with exponentially disastrous results. While the contemporary Covid-19 parallels are none too subtle, keeping the 1980s setting of Don DeLillo’s original novel proves an inspired choice on Baumbach’s part, one that accentuates the film’s darkly absurd comedy. By contrasting big hair and materialist excess against a rush for survival, White Noise serves up some authentic moments of humanity amid its chaos.

Daniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc in this brilliant follow-up to 2019’s phenomenal whodunnit, Knives Out. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a fiendishly sharp new case for “the Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths,” taking Blanc to a Greek island getaway for a reclusive tech billionaire and his collection of friends and hangers-on, where a planned murder mystery weekend takes a deadly literal turn. While totally accessible for newcomers, fans of the first film will also be rewarded with some deeper character development for Blanc, a role that’s shaping up to be as iconic for Craig as 007. As cleverly written and meticulously constructed as its predecessor, and featuring the kind of all-star cast—Edward Norton! Janelle Monáe! Kathryn Hahn! Leslie Odom Jr.! Jessica Henwick! Madelyn Cline! Kate Hudson! Dave Bautista!—that cinema dreams are made of, Glass Onion might be the best thing Netflix has dropped all year.

Facing obstacles in the form of Anna’s deeply religious family and a local community that distrusts her, Lib’s watch descends into a tense, terrifying experience. Based on the book of the same name by Emma Donoghue, The Wonder is a beautiful yet bleakly shot period piece that explores the all-too-mortal horrors that unquestioning religious fervor and family secrets can wreak.

All Quiet on the Western Front

Hopped up on nationalism and dreams of battlefield glory, Paul Bäumer (Felix Kammerer) is an eager young recruit for the German army during the last year of the First World War. His romantic view of the conflict is shattered on his first night in the cold trenches, surrounded by death and disaster, and dealt a tragic blow with the easy, meaningless loss of a dear friend. It's all downhill from there in this magnificently crafted adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's groundbreaking novel, one of the most important pieces of anti-war literature of the 20th century. Paul's journey is one of a loss of innocence, of naivete crushed by the relentless machine of war and state, and how soldiers on the ground are chewed up in the name of politicians and generals. Director Edward Berger's take on the material is the first to be filmed in German, adding a layer of authenticity and making for a blistering, heart-rending cinematic effort that drives home the horror and inhumanity of war. Often bleak, but an undeniably brilliant piece of filmmaking.

Enola Holmes 2

2020's original Enola Holmes proved to be a surprisingly enjoyable twist on the world's most famous detective, focusing instead on his overlooked sister, Enola. No surprise, then, that this follow-up is just as exciting a romp through Victorian London. Despite proving her skills in the first film, Enola struggles to establish her own detective credentials until a missing-person report leads her to a case that's stumped even Sherlock, and it sees her crossing paths with his archnemesis, Moriarty. Snappy action, clever twists, and bristling sibling rivalry from Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown and The Witcher's Henry Cavill as the Holmes siblings make for fun, family-friendly viewing. It even crams in a touch of vague historical accuracy by making the 1888 matchgirls' strike a key part of Enola's latest adventure.

The Platform

Goreng (Iván Massagué) awakes in a cell in a vertical prison, where food is provided only by a platform that descends level by level, pausing only long enough for inmates to eat before traveling ever lower. While there’s food enough for all, prisoners on higher levels gorge themselves, leaving those below to starve. It’s the perfect recipe for violence, betrayal, and rebellion in director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia’s tense Spanish thriller. Equal parts horror, dystopian sci-fi, and social commentary, The Platform works as a none-too-subtle commentary on consumption culture, but also a stark examination of the depths to which desperate people can sink. It’s absolutely not for everyone—scenes involving cannibalism and suicide make it a particularly troubling watch in places—but thanks to its claustrophobic, brutalist setting and stellar performances from its cast, The Platform is one of the most visually striking and narratively provocative films on Netflix.

Janney is phenomenal as the grizzled, broken, dangerous Lou, delivering action scenes that stand alongside some of Hollywood’s greatest. While it would be easy to reduce Lou to a gender-flipped Taken, with Lou painted as a similarly unstoppable force in hunting down the lost child, there’s much more going on in director Anna Foerster’s gritty thriller. This is ultimately a film centered on failed families and generational abuse, and how sometimes blood isn’t enough to bind people together. A dark, gripping action epic.

Do Revenge

At a glance, Do Revenge seems cut from the same cloth as Heathers and Mean Girls, simply bringing the high school retribution flick into the 2020s. However, writer-director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson (cowriter of Thor: Love and Thunder) adds a heavy layer of Strangers on a Train to her deliciously petty tale of grievance and teenage angst. When queen bee Drea (Riverdale's Camila Mendes) has a sex tape leaked by her boyfriend, she teams up with school outcast Eleanor (Stranger Things' Maya Hawke), victim of a rumor that she forced herself on another girl, to swap vendettas and socially destroy the other's bully. Of course, matters descend into chaos. But with a cast of brilliantly detestable characters making satisfyingly awful choices, a smart script that knows exactly how to play with (and poke fun at) the genre's tropes, and an incredible soundtrack, you'll be too hooked to look away.

Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood

Written, directed, and produced by Richard Linklater and using a style of rotoscope animation similar to that used in his films A Scanner Darkly and Waking Life, Apollo 10 1/2 is a mix of lazy summers, Saturday morning cartoons, and idealized memoir. Loosely based on Linklater’s own childhood growing up in Houston in the midst of the space race, the coming-of-age story follows a young boy named Stanley as he’s recruited to pilot the lunar lander—which NASA accidentally built too small for full-grown astronauts. Blending period social tensions (“Yeah, that’s a hippy”) with childhood imagination and excitement for the future, this is a distinctive piece of filmmaking dripping with an almost innocent sense of nostalgia.

Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus

Nickelodeon never quite knew how to handle Invader Zim. Back in 2001, Jhonen Vasquez’s sci-fi comedy about an inept alien attempting to take over the Earth was a massive underground hit, but it skewed a bit too dark for the kids’ network. Fast-forward two decades, and Zim—along with deranged robot companion GIR—is back to continue his invasion, with Vasquez let loose to create an animated movie without restraint. Channeling the classic series’ ludicrous sense of humor but with an even darker edge, this update sees Zim become a serious threat for once, and the Earth’s only hope is his arch enemy Dib—a paranoid schoolboy who’s spent the years since the show obsessively waiting for Zim’s resurgence. Packed with laugh-out-loud moments, big sci-fi ideas worthy of blockbuster franchises, and even some oddly touching—if appropriately nihilistic—moments exploring Dib’s family, Enter the Florpus is a very welcome return for a cult classic. Hopefully we won’t be waiting another two decades for Zim’s next invasion.

RRR

One of India’s biggest films of all time, RRR (or Rise, Roar, Revolt) redefines the notion of cinematic spectacle. Set in 1920, the historical epic follows real-life Indian revolutionaries Alluri Sitrama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.), but fictionalizes their lives and actions. Although drawn from very different walks of life, both men prove to be opposing the colonialist forces of the British Raj in their own way, their similarities drawing them together as they ultimately face down sadistic governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his cruel wife Catherine (Alison Doody). No mere period piece, RRR is a bold, exciting, and often explosive piece of filmmaking that elevates its heroes to near-mythological status, with director S. S. Rajamouli deploying ever-escalating, brilliantly-shot action scenes—and an exquisitely choreographed dance number—that grab viewers’ attention and refuse to let go. Whether you’re a longtime fan of Indian cinema or just looking for an action flick beyond the Hollywood norm, RRR is not to be missed.

The House

A stop-motion animated anthology film, The House is a dark, strange, borderline-experimental piece where the eponymous domicile is the main character. The first chapter follows a young girl called Mabel, whose impoverished parents are offered free residence in the impressive home but never seem to notice the shifting layout or their own increasing resemblance to the furniture. Things only get weirder as the house next appears in a world populated by anthropomorphic rats, where a property developer is trying to renovate it for sale but is plagued by very peculiar buyers, before shifting to a seemingly flooded world where its new inhabitants struggle to leave even as the waters around them continue to rise. A deliciously eerie triptych of tales, all centered on themes of loss and obsession, The House will delight fans of Coraline or The Corpse Bride.

I Lost My Body

An award winner at Cannes in 2019, this tale of burgeoning young love, obsession, and autonomous body parts is every bit as weird as you might expect for a French adult animated film. Director Jérémy Clapin charts the life of Naoufel, a Moroccan immigrant in modern-day France, falling for the distant Gabrielle, and Naoufel’s severed hand, making its way across the city to try and reconnect. With intersecting timelines and complex discussions about fate, I Lost My Body is often mind-bending yet always captivating, with brilliantly detailed animation and a phenomenal use of color throughout. Worth watching in both the original French and the solid English dub featuring Dev Patel and Alia Shawkat, just to try to make the most sense of it.

The Mitchells vs. the Machines

Aspiring filmmaker Katie Mitchell (voiced by Abbi Jacobson) has a strained relationship with her technophobic father Rick (Danny McBride)—not helped by his accidentally destroying her laptop right as she’s about to begin film school in California. In an effort to salvage their relationship, Rick decides to take the entire Mitchell family on a cross-country road trip to see Katie off. Unfortunately, said road trip coincides with a robot uprising that the Mitchells escape only by chance, leaving the fate of the world in their hands. Beautifully animated and brilliantly written, The Mitchells vs. the Machines takes a slightly more mature approach to family dynamics than many of its genre-mates, with the college-age Katie searching for her own identity and having genuine grievances with her father, but it effortlessly balances the more serious elements with exquisite action and genuinely funny comedy. Robbed of a full cinematic release by Covid-19, it now shines as one of Netflix’s best films.

Don’t Look Up

Frustrated by the world’s collective inaction on existential threats like climate change? Maybe don’t watch Don’t Look Up, director Adam McKay’s satirical black comedy. When two low-level astronomers discover a planet-killing comet on a collision course with Earth, they try to warn the authorities—only to be met with a collective “meh.” Matters only get worse when they try to leak the news themselves and have to navigate vapid TV news hosts, celebrities looking for a signature cause, and an indifferent public. A bleakly funny indictment of our times, bolstered by a star-studded cast fronted by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, Don’t Look Up is, somewhat depressingly, one of the best examinations of humanity since Idiocracy.

The Power of the Dog

In 2022, Netflix made its biggest play yet to win a Best Picture Oscar with The Power of the Dog. It lost to Apple TV+’s CODA, making it seem as though the streaming giant had lost to a much newer, younger player. It had, of course, but that shouldn’t take away from the fact that Jane Campion’s film is a wildly evocative tale about a brash rancher (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) in 1920s Montana who horribly mistreats his brother’s new wife and son. A critique of masculinity, Dog is beautifully shot and masterfully tense. While it didn’t win Best Picture, it’s still a great one—and nabbed Campion an Oscar for Best Director.

The Irishman

Based on the life of alleged mob hitman Frank Sheeran, captured in Charles Brandt’s book I Heard You Paint Houses, The Irishman essentially functions as a Martin Scorsese greatest-hits album. Featuring digitally de-aged Robert De Niro (as Sheeran) and Al Pacino (Jimmy Hoffa), the movie was trapped in development hell for years before Netflix arrived with the willingness to give Scorsese the creative license (and money) to make the movie his way. It's perhaps too long, at three and a half hours, and that de-aging technology still needs a little improvement, but the 10 Oscar nominations speak for themselves.

Mank

An intricate study of a cinematic masterpiece? Or two hours and 11 minutes of Gary Oldman lying around and getting tanked in bed? Mank is both. After Roma, David Fincher gets his turn at a monochrome, prestige Netflick with this look at screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, otherwise known as the guy who wrote Citizen Kane with Orson Welles. Or, more accurately, as the film demonstrates, for Orson Welles. All that old Hollywood fancy and snappy dialog is here, but Fincher is also interested in movie moguls, fake news, the women behind the men, and creative credit. Bonus points for Amanda Seyfried’s wonderful turn as actress Marion Davies.

A colossal hit in its native China, The Wandering Earth earned more than $700 million (£550 million) at the country's box office, prompting Netflix to snap up the rights to stream the sci-fi sensation internationally. The film follows a group of astronauts, sometime far into the future, attempting to guide the Earth away from the sun, which is expanding into a red giant. The problem? Jupiter is also in the way. While the Earth is being steered by 10,000 fire-blowing engines that have been strapped to the surface, the humans still living on the planet must find a way to survive the ever changing environmental conditions.

Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom

Chadwick Boseman’s final film before his untimely death is one set almost entirely in a sweaty recording studio in 1920s Chicago. Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom centers on the mother of the blues, played by Viola Davis, as she clashes with bandmates and white producers while trying to record an album. Davis delivers a stellar performance, perfectly reflecting the tensions of the time, but it’s Boseman who is completely electrifying onscreen, stealing every scene he’s in. The actor truly couldn’t have done any better for his final outing as trumpeter Levee.

I’m Thinking of Ending Things

Much as with his previous films Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, director Charlie Kaufman created quite the head-spinner with this Netflix drama. In I’m Thinking of Ending Things, Lucy (Jessie Buckley) travels with boyfriend Jake (Jesse Plemons) to meet his parents for the first time at their secluded farmhouse. But all the while Lucy narrates her desire to end things with Jake, and questions why she’s going on this trip in the first place. Cue an incredibly uncomfortable dinner with parents Toni Collette and David Thewlis (both excellent) and a confusing journey that flits through time. It should be noted that you simply won’t understand all (or frankly, any) of the elements of this mind-bending film. However, once you get all the answers, it’s hard not to admire and appreciate the complexities of loss and loneliness Kaufman has imbued in this drama.

This time it’s in Vietnam, where four Black military veterans have returned to find the remains of their fallen squad leader and a gold fortune they left behind. The film is a multilayered analysis of the racism suffered by the Black soldiers who were defending a country that simply did not value their lives, and the brutality the Vietnamese people were subjected to in the long, painful, and—as it’s known in the film—American War. As you would expect, a film that focuses so closely on these difficult themes is no easy watch, and there are moments of intense brutality.

5/5/2023 15:00,The Marvel Movies From Worst to Best—and Where to Stream Them,"IN MAY 2008, the recently formed Marvel Studios released its first movie—and changed the face of modern cinema. Iron Man wasn’t even the highest-grossing superhero film of the year (Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight took that crown), but it was a kernel that has exploded into an all-consuming entertainment juggernaut. Fifteen years later, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a sprawling, interconnected web of character-based movies and crossovers that has pulled in billions at the box office.

But which Marvel movies are the best, and worst, of the bunch? Is Iron Man 3 better than Iron Man 2? How bad was The Incredible Hulk? How does Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 hold up against its predecessors? We’ve spent hours arguing about the relative merits of Doctor Strange and Black Widow, and at the end of it, we’ve got some irreparably damaged working relationships and the definitive ranking of every movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Related note: It takes nearly three days to watch all 32 Marvel movies back to back. Most of them are now available on Disney+, and you can read our guide to the best films on Disney+ to see what else is worth watching when you’re done—until The Marvels arrives in theaters in November.

32. Eternals

Eternals faced an uphill battle, as it was one of the first movies to get caught up in Covid-19 delays. While it originally completed shooting in February 2020, the bulk of its post-production was handled remotely and reshoots had to be done nearly 10 months later. Add several delays due to movie theater closures, and fans ended up waiting about three years to see it. But rather than an easy slide into this new world of the Eternals—an alien race of immortal superheroes who have been living in secrecy for thousands of years—audiences got a full-on, Avengers-style epic they weren’t quite ready for. While the film garnered praise for its sumptuous visuals and innovative direction by Chloé Zhao, and for bringing a whole new philosophical bent to the MCU, it ultimately felt like a futile exercise.

31. The Incredible Hulk

This largely forgotten Marvel movie followed closely on the heels of Iron Man’s success, but relative to the other films in the series, it was a critical and commercial flop. Edward Norton did a perfectly fine job as Bruce Banner, but the story goes that he wanted more creative control than a tightly related web of movies would allow and so was replaced by Mark Ruffalo before The Avengers (aka Avengers Assemble) four years later. (Ruffalo, it turns out, had actually been The Incredible Hulk director Louis Leterrier’s first choice for the smashing green superhero.) The film feels very dark and gloomy compared to the brightness of Marvel’s later efforts, and the CGI has not aged well. But most importantly, recasting with such a different actor meant that the events of this film have largely been ignored ever since—a number of seeds were planted that never bore fruit, and Banner’s emotional backstory and relationship with Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler) were never mentioned again, which seemed to suit some fans just fine—until now. In March, it was announced that Tyler would reprise her role in the upcoming Captain America: New World Order.

30. Iron Man 2

It’s tough for any sequel to match—let alone surpass—the success of its cinematic predecessor, and Iron Man 2 was certainly not up to the task. Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as the eponymous superhero, going head-to-head with the US government, which is worried about what could happen if Tony Stark’s tech falls into the wrong hands. Officials spend so much time pestering Stark that a new threat escapes their notice—in the form of Ivan Vanko, aka Whiplash, a Russian physicist who’s got a bone to pick with Stark. Mickey Rourke, fresh off his Oscar-nominated role in The Wrestler, has spent the past decade-plus trashing the movie and the MCU’s “crap acting,” which hasn’t helped the film’s legacy.

29. Thor: The Dark World

One of the things you realize when you sit down and actually rank all 32 MCU films is how few duds there are. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and his colleagues have done a remarkable job of turning out some pretty solid pictures, and there are few genuinely bad entries in the series. Unfortunately, this is one of them. The Dark World was beset by problems from the start, including extensive rewrites and even director changes. Despite all that work put into making the best picture possible, the plot—which features Dark Elves, frost monsters, and a malicious substance called the Aether—feels a bit distant. Fortunately, Thor managed to rebound with 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok.

28. Iron Man 3

If Downey’s final solo outing as Iron Man marked the end of an era, it would best be summed up as an era of mediocre movies starring a massive talent, making the end of them far less sad for filmgoers. The plot of the third film revolves around Tony Stark’s PTSD in the wake of the Battle of New York as he takes on The Mandarin, a mysterious figure who turns out to be a debauched actor in a television studio, played with all the respect that plot twist deserves by Oscar winner Ben Kingsley.

27. Avengers: Age of Ultron

The Avengers’ second group outing is a joyous jumble of a movie in which the superheroes start to really click as a team. Stark’s mad-scientist-playing-God routine spirals out of control (in a good way) when he blends Asgardian heirlooms with AI and advanced robotics. The Avengers end up having to battle Ultron, a Terminator-esque abomination with some unsurprising designs on the future of humankind (read: extinction). That Ultron has a couple of rogue superheroes doing his bidding provides extra fun. After the monster bot is obliterated and the rogues are won over to the other side, a glimpse of Thanos’ purple mug reminds us that this was likely all part of a wider plot. Then again, isn’t everything in the MCU part of a wider plot?

26. Thor: Love and Thunder

Not even Taika Waititi could live up to the incredibly high standard he set with the universally beloved Thor: Ragnarok. While Waititi’s comic tendencies are on full display, Love and Thunder—much like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 before it—feels a little too familiar to its predecessor to fully stand out on its own. Still, Chris Hemsworth is utterly charming as the flawed and vulnerable God of Thunder, who is forced out of retirement in order to stop a new enemy, Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), from doing exactly what his name implies. Together with his King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Waititi), and his newly superhero-empowered ex Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Thor sets about stopping Gorr, and uncovering the reason behind his hatred of the gods in the first place.

Twenty years after first bringing Spider-Man to the big screen in a pre-MCU world, Sam Raimi officially crashed the Marvel party with this Doctor Strange sequel starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen and Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen and Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen. Basically, there are a lot of versions of their characters, Dr. Stephen Strange and Wanda Maximoff, some of whom are up to no good. Like the first Strange film, this one feels like it exists just outside of the MCU—or more to provide connective tissue between other segments of the superhero universe than as a full-fledged solo effort. The movie does, however, feature some of the franchise’s most notable talents (count the Oscar nominations) and the sequel brings Raimi back to his Evil Dead roots, making this a movie for superhero aficionados and horror movie fans alike.

24. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania

As one of Hollywood’s most likable actors, Paul Rudd was a stellar choice for the petty criminal-turned-tiny superhero Scott Lang/Ant-Man. He’s also a worthy successor to serve as the face of the MCU’s Phase Five (this is the film that’s kicking it all off), much in the same way that Robert Downey Jr. did for Phase One. While Rudd is as charming as ever, this newest solo outing is decidedly darker than its predecessors, as Ant-Man and the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) are swept up into the Quantum Realm, where they’re forced to face off against baddie Kang the Conqueror, a scientist from the 31st century who has stumbled upon the Multiverse. 

23. Thor

Chris Hemsworth’s Thor serves as a valuable source of comic relief in many of the more recent MCU movies, but his first outing—in this Kenneth Branagh–helmed film—had a much more serious vibe. At the start of the film, Thor is exiled on Earth and deemed unworthy to wield his hammer, which has crashed into the desert in New Mexico. He strikes up a romance with astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who has come to investigate the matter. As usual, it’s Tom Hiddleston as Loki—Thor’s brother—who steals the show, but it’s all a little too serious to find itself in the top half of this list.

22. Doctor Strange

Preeminent New York City neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange is as pompous as he is talented, which makes it impossible for him to accept that his career is over when a car crash leaves him unable to use his hands. In an attempt to reclaim his professional standing, Strange travels to a monastery in Kathmandu, where resident mystics are rumored to have mastered sorcery. After meeting the monastery’s chief warlock, the Ancient One, Strange forgets all about his injured hands as he becomes absorbed in ancient books, exploring the astral plane, and shooting green beams from his fingers. The appearance of a transcendental baddie hell-bent on destroying the magical shields protecting Earth from inter-dimensional villains triggers wizardry battles galore. The visually ingenious film gets points for introducing Cumberbatch to the MCU; unfortunately, that’s not enough to save it from a low ranking.

21. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

The second outing of Star-Lord, Gamora, Groot, and company is a perfectly enjoyable film. It just feels like a fairly by-the-numbers retread of the first one, which connected with audiences through its unexpected comedy and the chemistry between its quirky characters, including a wisecracking raccoon and a talking tree. While the sequel attempted to recapture some of that magic, it just couldn’t stick the landing. Or the middle bit, really. The Vol. 2 mixtape has been credited as one of the forces behind the cassette tape’s comeback, which is something to be thankful for.

20. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings

While the idea of adapting Marvel’s Shang-Chi comic for the big screen was first broached in the early 2000s, it took nearly two decades for the film to get there. Simu Liu made history in the role of Shang-Chi, the MCU’s first Asian superhero, who led a predominantly Asian cast. In the present day, Shang-Chi works as a parking valet—an occupation that helps him mask his past as a highly trained martial arts expert who carried out an assassination when he was just 14 years old. But as Shang-Chi is dragged back into the world of a mysterious group known as the Ten Rings, his past comes bubbling back up to the surface, which proves to be both a blessing and a curse. A sequel is currently in development.

19. Captain America: The First Avenger

The First Avenger is a sepia-toned love story that follows Steve Rogers’ (Chris Evans) transformation from scrawny patriot to super soldier with the help of a special serum. The film’s historical setting means it’s different in tone from many of the other entries in the series, but that may be a good thing; critics praised its depiction of the 1940s. Of all the films in the series, Captain America perhaps feels the most coherent as a stand-alone flick.

18. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3

If this were a ranking of Most Depressing Marvel Movies, this one would definitely rank within the top five. That isn’t a knock on the movie—just a fact, as well as a surprising turn of events from James Gunn, who brought some much-needed playfulness to the MCU with the original Guardians of the Galaxy (which helped to wipe away the stink of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World). Nearly a decade later, the Guardians are still delivering that same quippy energy that makes the movies seem like a Western one moment and a screwball comedy the next, yet there’s an underlying sadness here. Plot-wise, that’s because it tackles Rocket Raccoon’s backstory, which should come with an #AdoptDontShop hashtag. It’s also one of the first movies to truly examine the emotional toll “The Snap” took on our favorite superheroes. But it’s also hard to imagine that knowing this would be Gunn’s Marvel swan song, and the last time this ragtag team of filmmakers would be working together to create a story about this ragtag team of superheroes, wouldn't bleed into the script. Sure, there are some mawkish moments. But overall, it’s a fittingly moving sendoff for Gunn and the forgotten comic book characters he turned into cinematic icons. 

17. Ant-Man and the Wasp

The success of 2015’s Ant-Man sparked an unexpected sequel that takes the series even deeper into the quantum realm. The title character’s ability to shrink and grow on demand makes for some visually arresting fight scenes, and it brings the same humor and levity that made the first film a hit along with it. But the actual plot, if you really think about it, is deeply silly. Then again, maybe that’s what we all needed after the Snap. Although Ant-Man and the Wasp came out after Infinity War, most of the action takes place beforehand, with the exception of a stunning post-credits scene.

16. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever

It’s possible no Marvel movie will ever top Black Panther—that’s why it’s Number 1 on this list. But if you think of Wakanda Forever as a movie that both honors the legacy of Chadwick Boseman, who played T’Challa in several Marvel films and tragically died in 2020, and continues the story of the nation of Wakanda, then this is a worthy sequel. Director Ryan Coogler not only introduced the world to a new Black Panther, he also brought along Riri Williams (aka Ironheart) and Namor, too. It’s as gut-wrenching as it is action-packed.

15. Captain America: Civil War

Although Civil War is officially a solo Captain America outing, it plays out more like an ensemble Avengers story, with a huge cast of characters split into rival factions by the Sokovia Accords—a legal agreement that puts tighter controls on superheroes and was introduced after Tony Stark’s rogue AI dropped an entire city in Age of Ultron. Stark, cowed by his role in creating Ultron, is allied with the government and has Black Widow, Black Panther, Vision, and Spider-Man on his side. Meanwhile, Steve Rogers and his team—which includes Ant-Man, Hawkeye, and Wanda Maximoff, who are probably not the favorites on paper—go rogue to track down Hydra’s Helmut Zemo and bring in Bucky Barnes.

14. Black Widow

Given that Scarlett Johansson has been an integral part of the MCU since 2010’s Iron Man 2, her 2021 debut solo feature seemed long overdue. But the wait may have been worth it, as Black Widow feels much more like a stand-alone movie than probably any other solo outing in the MCU and introduces a solid new cast of characters, including Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, a fellow Black Widow and sister-like figure to Johansson. It largely follows the Marvel formula of action, action, and more action and plays out more like a Bond film in that way—which isn’t a bad thing—but it also contends with the very specific issues of female independence and the effects of surviving trauma. While it allowed longtime fans to dive deeper into the past of Johansson’s notoriously mysterious Natasha Romanoff (aka Black Widow), it also—finally!—gave audiences the chance to see a slightly different and more vulnerable side of the Avenger. It’s just too bad it took Marvel more than a decade to finally give fans that moment.

13. The Avengers

Thanks to the MCU, crossovers have become such a common occurrence at the theater that it’s easy to forget the impact of first seeing Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, and more combine forces. The Avengers—or Avengers Assemble, as it’s known in the UK—delivers some great moments during the Battle of New York, which becomes a key plot point in the next phase of the story, and in many of the spin-off television series. The film wouldn’t work without the strength of the supporting characters, but it’s Mark Ruffalo’s quieter, more measured take on the Hulk that stands out.

12. Captain America: The Winter Soldier

The Winter Soldier felt vital when it was released in 2014, but it tends to merge into a general blur of close-quarters combat and severed limbs. It follows Captain America’s attempts to track down the Winter Soldier, a mysterious and powerful assassin who turns out to be his close personal friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Like Cap, the Winter Soldier was also kept on ice for most of the 70 years after World War II; unlike Cap, he was brainwashed by the evil Hydra. A rehabilitated Winter Soldier appears in both Infinity War and Endgame, and Stan has a few films left in his contract, so it might be worth rewatching this one for future reference.

10. Captain Marvel

Marvel’s biggest mistake in the entire MCU canon (so far) was not commissioning Captain Marvel sooner. The film, which is set in the past, sees the rise of Marvel (Brie Larson) as she discovers her origin story and develops her powers. The only real flaw in the movie is that it doesn’t convincingly explain what happened to Marvel between the end of the title and what comes years later in Endgame.

Who doesn’t love a heist movie? Rudd’s MCU debut acted as something of a palate cleanser after the heavy and (literally) Earth-shattering events of Age of Ultron. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a reformed criminal who teams up with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter (Evangeline Lily) to keep Pym’s shrinking technology from falling into the wrong hands. The film’s depiction of quantum physics wouldn’t hold much water at CERN, but it’s terrific fun—thanks in large part to Michael Peña’s star turn as Lang’s former cellmate Luis.

7. Spider-Man: Homecoming

Spider-Man: Homecoming marked the third attempt in just 15 years to bring a new take on Spider-Man to screens. While the resulting effort could easily have felt a bit been there, done that, director Jon Watts and lead actor Tom Holland managed to breathe new life into the superhero, making Spidey feel modern, fresh, and really quite charming. The introduction of Downey’s Iron Man as a key character in the plot situates the film nicely in the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe without feeling heavy-handed. And the balance of Spider-Man’s action-packed adventuring with Parker’s everyday high school drama makes for a character that is more relatable than previous iterations. There’s plenty of cool web-slinging and day-saving, but it’s the humanity of the film that propels it to a top spot on our list.

6. Avengers: Endgame

There’s a moment in Endgame—the event movie to end all event movies—when you realize that what writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have done is to go full Harry Potter and the Cursed Child all over the MCU. If your mind could throw up a little bit in its mouth, it would. Once you learn to accept this, you can settle in. And once you get past the glum first 45 minutes, you can open your heart for the good stuff: wise Stark, Professor Hulk, the (controversial) Lebowski Thor, Doctor Strange holding up one finger, Black Widow and Captain Marvel kicking ass (both emotionally and physically), and almost every character you’ve ever met having a moment. It’s a messy but epic baton pass in the form of an angsty, portal-powered mega-battle. And we’re not going to lie: We’ve watched those audience reaction videos and they, too, are a thing of joy.

5. Guardians of the Galaxy

From its opening sequence, where Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord dances through an abandoned alien vault on a distant planet to “Come and Get Your Love,” it was clear that Guardians of the Galaxy would bring something truly otherworldly to the MCU. It was not a well-known comic storyline, but the film provided a much-needed shot of humor for a series in danger of becoming a little too serious after the events of The Winter Soldier. With a soundtrack of ’70 and ’80s hits, and Pratt at the helm of a band of entertaining misfits, it became an instant fan favorite.

4. Spider-Man: No Way Home

In Spider-Man: No Way Home, the unthinkable happens: Spider-Man’s identity is revealed to the world, putting both the superhero and the people he loves in danger of being targeted by his enemies. So Spidey does the only thing he can think to do: call in Dr. Strange to help the world forget what they’ve learned about him. While the film maintains the sense of wonderment and fun we’ve seen in previous Spider-Man tales, it also plays with the fact that we have seen a lot of web-slingers come and go, and it goes so far as to bring Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back into the fold as Strange tries to help Peter Parker with his identity crisis.

3. Iron Man

The first MCU title is still one of the best. Released way back in 2008, Iron Man debuted just a year after the first iPhone was introduced. At the time, Thanos was just a tiny thought in the bigger MCU world. Still, Iron Man has aged well. Stark’s trademark stubbornness and arrogance are peppered throughout the film and only increase when he breaks free from his kidnappers and creates the first metallic suit. From there, Stark’s legacy is assured—and the MCU’s first official superhero is born.

2. Thor: Ragnarok

Taika Waititi’s Thor—as it shall forever be known in cinephile circles—came close to the top spot because it is, quite simply, a masterpiece. A spacey, Day-Glo masterpiece. Switching up the sometimes-grating Marvel sass and the not-quite-working Thor formula for something much more awkward and genuinely odd, Ragnarok is postmodern (but not in a pretentious way) and by far the funniest Marvel movie to date. Cate Blanchett’s villain Hela doesn’t get the zingers, sure, but Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie is a drunken delight, and then there’s Jeff Goldblum. Every detail of the story of Thor and Hulk’s side mission and the defense of Asgard has been meticulously put together in the manner of a trippy indie film—which is all the more impressive when you consider this is a huge Disney flick.

1. Black Panther

With Black Panther, director Ryan Coogler broke the superhero film mold in many respects, elevating the genre in such a way that it managed to please both fans and critics—to the extent that, in 2019, it became the first superhero film to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. Basically, everything about this film is fantastic: the casting, the costumes, the plot, the performances. The setting of the secretly technologically advanced nation of Wakanda is a true cinematic treat, and Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa is matched by an unusually three-dimensional villain in the form of Michael B. Jordan’s Killmonger, whose backstory gives pause for thought beyond a simple good-versus-evil narrative. Add in multiple female characters who each have more substance than most superhero films’ entire casts put together, and Black Panther is the perfect example of how good a Marvel film can be. While its sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, will arrive later this year, it’s hard to imagine what that will look like without the late Boseman leading the way.

The Diplomat

If there's a West Wing-shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat—a tense geopolitical thriller elevated beyond the norms of the genre by a superb central performance by The Americans' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate's role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis before it escalates into full-blown war. It's a job that might go easier if her own special relationship with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) weren't fraying, as his resentment at being demoted leads him to interfere in her efforts. One of Netflix's biggest hits of 2023, The Diplomat has already been renewed for season two.

Sweet Tooth

Based on the comic book by Jeff Lemire, Sweet Tooth is set 10 years after “The Sick”: a viral pandemic that killed most of the population, and led—somehow—to babies being born with part-human, part-animal characteristics. The first season follows Gus, a half-deer hybrid boy who leaves the wilderness in search of his mother, and “Big Man” Tommy Jeppard, a grizzled traveler who becomes his reluctant guide, protecting him from surviving humans who hate and fear the hybrids. The newly-dropped second season takes things into darker territory, merging Gus and Jeppard’s path with the once-disparate storyline of Aditya Singh (Adeel Akhtar), a scientist researching the origins of The Sick—and its connections to Gus. Part sci-fi, part fantasy, part mystery, Sweet Tooth offers viewers a postapocalyptic dystopia unlike any other.

The Dragon Prince

Premiering on Netflix back in 2018, The Dragon Prince has had something of a slow-burn journey to cult favorite status—not helped by lower frame rate animation in its first season—but this sharp fantasy has more than earned its devoted fanbase. Set in a fantasy world where humans, elves, and dragons have lived apart for centuries, the show's first three-season arc follows human half-brothers Ezran and Callum as they are drawn together with elven assassin Rayla to return the last dragon egg to safety. Co-created by Avatar: The Last Airbender’s Aaron Ehasz, this ventures into similarly mature territory as it progresses, navigating themes of war and loss while brilliantly developing an expansive cast of characters. With its second multi-season arc—The Mystery of Aaravos—underway now, there’s no better time to dip into this rich universe of magic and myth.

JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure

In Victorian England, Jonathan Joestar clashes with his deranged adoptive brother Dio Brando, starting a centuries-long feud that will sweep the globe. This is no mere tale of warring clans, though, as Dio’s dabbling with dark forces sees him returning over the eras to plague Jonathan’s decendents anew. Luckily, each generation of the Joestar family has a champion (each with a name that can be trimmed to JoJo) to rise to the challenge, mastering arcane abilities of their own—notably summoning ghostly giants known as Stands—to combat Dio and a host of other supernatural threats across the ages. Original creator Hirohiko Araki drew influence from Western rock music and high fashion for his saga, which combine with exagerrated physiques and hyperkinetic action to make this anime adaptation visually and tonally unique. The decision to focus each season on a different era also makes for a surprisingly digestible viewing experience, despite the scope. Honestly, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure is nonsense at times—but such hyper-stylish nonsense that you’ll easily be swept up in the madness. Just remember, the key word in the title is “bizarre”!

You

Based on the novels of Caroline Kepnes, You is an often deeply disturbing tale of obsession. The first season follows Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley), a bookstore manager in New York who falls in deranged love at first sight with aspiring author Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail), while the second sees him relocate to Los Angeles, where heiress Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti) becomes the focus of his attention. However, as their twisted relationship evolves, Love proves to have dark desires of her own. Often shocking, You is a gripping thriller that hits the same sinister sweet spot as early (read: good) seasons of Dexter.

Naoki Urasawa’s Monster

When Kenzo Tenma, a brilliant surgeon working in Düsseldorf, opts to save the life of a wounded orphan over the city’s mayor, he thinks he’s made the right decision. A decade later, the boy he saved, Johan, is a serial killer with a horrifying body count. Feeling responsible for the lives lost as a result of the one he saved—and suspected of killing several of Johan’s victims himself—Tenma goes on the run, partly to clear his name and partly to correct the mistake he made years before. A deeply complex psychological thriller, this anime adaptation of Naoki Urasawa’s groundbreaking manga is capable of shaking you to your core. The only downside? This 2004 series has yet to be remastered in high definition, but once you’re caught up in the high stakes cat-and-mouse battle of wills between Tenma and his former patient, you won’t care.

The Legend of Korra

Set 70 years after Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra explores how Avatar Aang's once war-torn world has progressed after decades of relative peace. When Korra, the new Avatar, moves to Republic City to complete her training in manipulating the primal elements under the tutelage of Tenzin—Aang's son, now with a family of his own—she and her new friends Mako and Bolin find themselves caught in the growing tensions between those with the ability to ""bend"" elements and the Equalist movement, who claim the unpowered are an oppressed class. As the series progresses over its four seasons, The Legend of Korra proves itself a very different beast than its predecessor, exploring political themes and social prejudices in deeper—and often darker—detail, while also expanding the more fantastic elements of the universe and revealing the origins of the first Avatar. Even more brilliantly animated than its predecessor, and with a unique 1920s inspired aesthetic, Korra is a show that grew up alongside its audience, and is all the stronger for it.

Lost in Space

It’s a few years old at this point, but Netflix’s update of the classic 1960s sci-fi show is one of the rarest entries on the service now—a genre show that the streamer can’t cancel after one season, because it’s already completed its three-season run. That means you can settle in to this glossier take on the Robinson family and their desperate attempt to survive on an alien planet without fear of a permanent cliffhanger or a never-coming conclusion. The stakes are far higher in this reboot though, with the Robinsons trapped on a dangerous alien world after an attempt to evacuate a doomed Earth goes disastrously wrong. Stranded, with no way to reunite with the colony mission they were once part of, the family’s fate may rest with a strange robot befriended by youngest son Will—but unlike in the original show, this robot caused the disaster that stranded them. With less saccharine family dynamics than the original, less camp (with the arguable exception of Parker Posey, stealing scenes as the nefarious Dr. Smith), and a more ambitious long-form story stretching across its three seasons, Lost in Space is a strong update for modern viewers.

Kleo

If you’re pining for more Killing Eve, this German thriller may be the next best thing. Set in the late 1980s and early ’90s, the eight-part series follows the eponymous Kleo (Jella Haase), a Stasi assassin imprisoned by her agency on false treason charges. Released after the fall of the Berlin Wall, she seeks revenge on her former handlers—but West German detective Sven (Dimitrij Schaad), the only witness to her last kill, may have something to say about that. As dark and violent as you’d expect given the period and the themes of betrayal and vengeance, Kleo is lightened by its oft-deranged sense of humor and a charismatic lead duo who brilliantly bounce off one another. In late 2022, Netflix confirmed that there would be a second season, so now’s a perfect chance to catch up.

Physical: 100

A spiritual successor to the likes of Gladiators, with a dash of Squid Game thrown in for good measure, this Korean reality show puts 100 contestants who are “in top physical shape” through a series of grueling challenges, and the last one standing wins a significant cash prize. Unlike previous endurance shows, though, Physical: 100 sees men and women compete together, with an international roster chasing glory. The only limit? Their own ability. The inventive challenges—including the sheer spectacle of dragging a fully loaded ship weighing 2.2 tons across a sand-filled arena—are awe-inspiring, and the psychological drama of rivals having to form teams to progress is engrossing. But what’s most impressive is the sheer feats of human ability on display, even as competitors are eliminated over the course of each roughly hour-long episode. The worst part? You’re definitely going to feel you need to up your workout goals after seeing this.

Cowboy Bebop

No, not Netflix’s live-action remake (although that really isn’t as bad as certain corners of the internet would have you think), but the 1998 animated original. Cowboy Bebop is often referred to as a gateway drug to anime, and it’s easy to see why—with its achingly cool characters, imaginative approaches to science fiction and cyberpunk in nearly every episode, and some of the smoothest animation ever committed to screen, the (mis-)adventures of down-on-their-luck bounty hunters Spike, Jet, Faye, and Ed (plus Ein, a corgi with genius-level intelligence) grab viewers from the start. It’s not just the spectacle that’s ensured Cowboy Bebop’s cultural standing over the last quarter-century, though—this is a show that uses its neo-noir and space Western trappings to explore themes of loneliness, regret, and ennui to deliver emotional blows as well. Powered by Yoko Kanno’s blisteringly brilliant jazz-infused soundtrack, Cowboy Bebop remains a masterpiece.

Lockwood & Co.

Based on the books by Jonathan Stroud and developed by Attack the Block director Joe Cornish, Lockwood & Co. follows a group of teen ghost hunters in an alternate present-day Britain. Don’t expect a transatlantic take on the recent Ghostbusters reboot though—this is a world where children are the only people able to combat the malign spirits plaguing the living. When Lucy Carlisle (Ruby Stokes) relocates to London after a mission in her hometown goes horribly wrong, she joins the eponymous ghost-hunting agency, run by teen savant Anthony Lockwood (Cameron Chapman) and his ally George (Ali Hadji-Heshmati). Dodging the adult-run organizations that typically send kids out to tackle the “Visitors,” the trio aims to make a name for themselves—and maybe prove that the authorities don’t have undead matters under control at all. Satisfyingly spooky, with some top-tier action and a talented young cast that relishes Cornish’s trademark sharp dialogue, Lockwood & Co. is a great addition to Netflix’s wider canon of supernatural teen dramas—and one that boasts a killer post-punk soundtrack to boot.

“A heist 25 years in the making” is how Netflix hypes this ambitious crime drama, following master thief Leo Pap (the ever-watchable Giancarlo Esposito) and his crew’s effort to steal a staggering $7 billion haul. However, that doesn’t quite do Kaleidoscope justice. It’s not just the audacity of the crime that impresses, or how the show weaves in and out of its cast’s lives over the quarter century leading up to, and shortly after, the heist itself, but the fact that you can watch the eight-episode season in any order. Netflix has dabbled with interactivity in the past, with game-like special episodes or spinoffs of popular shows, but Kaleidoscope takes that idea to a new level, with an almost Choose Your Own Adventure approach that offers a unique experience for every viewer. The unusual format is admittedly part of the charm—as a linear crime drama, it might not have the same appeal—but Kaleidoscope truly feels like something new on the platform, and with a possible 40,320 viewing orders, it’s worth at least one.

5/5/2023 13:33,Doctors Behind Mifepristone Ban Called ‘Christians’ a Top Threat,"AN ADVOCACY GROUP suing the federal government in a bid to limit nationwide access to the abortion drug mifepristone has wrestled for a decade to conceal the influence its religious beliefs exert over its public policy pursuits. The doctor-focused organization, which calls itself the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds), wants to ban abortion, affirmative care for transgender youth, and the parental rights of non-hetero couples

ACPeds has long described itself, publicly and in court, as a “secular, scientific medical association.” But hundreds of confidential records leaked last month raise serious doubts about the veracity of those claims. A cache of more than 10,000 files inadvertently exposed by the group’s website, as first reported by WIRED on Tuesday, shows that ACPeds’ board members have continuously struggled to contain their motives and have debated the “pros and cons” of openly declaring their religious foundation.

The American College of Pediatricians, which is not a school, is joined by three other conservative medical groups and four physicians in pursuing the ban on mifepristone. A US federal appeals court hearing the case in New Orleans will convene later this month to hear arguments on whether to reverse or uphold a district court ruling that imposed a nationwide stay of the Federal Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of mifepristone in April, effectively blocking access to the drug. 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

The US Supreme Court intervened to halt the order in mid-April after an emergency relief petition was filed by the FDA. The case is now back with the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which is arguably the nation’s most conservative court.

Following publication, ACPeds executive director Jill Simons said in a statement that the group's online presence had been hit with a sustained cyberattack since April 24. She did not specify what this entailed. The documents reported by WIRED were found on a Google Drive that was open to the public, a link to which was discovered on the group's website. WIRED emailed ACPeds about the drive last week, after which it promptly became private.

Simons said the organization had been subject to “bullying tactics that amount to a hate crime.” A ""hate crime"" is defined under federal law as a crime motivated by bias against race, religion, or sexual orientation, among other protected categories. It is not clear which protected category ACPeds is claiming to be a member of. WIRED has requested clarification.

Simons added that the group intends to “continue to promote the health and well-being of children by protecting the rights of born and preborn children, promoting biological integrity, and defending conscience rights for healthcare professionals.”

Board meeting minutes dated as far back as 2014 raise questions about the group's candor in its public portrayals of its work and the means by which it arrives at seemingly medical-based recommendations. The group has claimed on its website not to “inquire about or use an individual's religious or political identification as criteria for membership,” a statement aimed at assuaging concerns that its recommendations aren’t backed purely by medical science. Documents reviewed by WIRED, however, show that the group views “mainstream medicine, psychology, [and] academia” as top threats to its mission. ",https://www.wired.com/story/american-college-pediatrics-christian-threat/,,,,,,,,
5/5/2023 10:07,The Long Covid Mystery Has a New Suspect,"WHEEZING AFTER GETTING on the treadmill. Gulping down air while doing chores. Breathlessness is one of the many scary and frustrating symptoms that can linger in Covid patients months after their initial infection. But while these symptoms were a mystery at the beginning of the pandemic, scientists are slowly unraveling their causes—moving us closer to finding a treatment.

In a paper recently published in the European Respiratory Journal, researchers at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom identified a probable culprit—immune cells known as monocytes. These squishy, blue-gray cells float through the bloodstream, looking for signs of trouble. When they encounter an invading pathogen, such as bacteria or a virus, they generate other crucial immune cells and alert the immune system to activate additional defenses. Monocytes are particularly important during lung injury. At the first sign of trouble, they move to the lungs, spawning various specialized macrophages—immune cells that eat pathogens—that become the first line of immunological defense against germs invading.

But it appears a Covid infection can really mess up how these immune cells work—meaning they “can respond abnormally to subsequent events,” says Laurence Pearmain, a clinical lecturer at the University of Manchester and coauthor of the paper. In Covid patients with lasting breathlessness after an infection, the researchers found monocytes with irregularities. Compared to healthy people, these patients had monocytes with different levels of proteins attached to them that are critical for directing the cells toward the lungs. These results, the scientists say, link abnormal monocytes with long Covid and lung injury—paving the way for potential therapies to correct the abnormalities or alleviate symptoms.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Pearmain and the team had good reason to suspect these cells. Other researchers had already found that SARS-CoV-2 affects monocytes. According to Judy Lieberman, a biologist at Harvard Medical School, in cases of severe Covid, monocytes infected with the virus often die in a way that releases lots of alarm molecules into the body, triggering large amounts of additional inflammation. “It’s like a feed-forward loop,” she says. “Once this gets going, it’s incredibly hard to control.” These results pointed to the potential role of dysfunctional monocytes in long Covid, as inflammation is known to contribute to some lasting symptoms.

Pearmain and the team decided to investigate. To figure out exactly what these cells were doing during Covid and long Covid, the scientists turned to blood sampling. Starting in the summer of 2020, across several hospitals in the UK, Pearmain and the team took blood from 71 patients during their hospital stays for Covid. Over the next few months, they also collected blood from 142 separate patients previously hospitalized for Covid, gathering samples during their follow-up visits.

The patients being followed up on had had Covid around six months earlier, and by this point after an infection, Pearmain says, you would expect any immune dysfunction caused by the virus to have settled down. Yet this wasn’t what the team was seeing. “It was obvious that a lot of people were still really struggling with breathlessness, fatigue, and a lot of the other long Covid symptoms,” he says. Specifically, 48 percent of the patients being followed up reported shortness of breath, 44 percent fatigue. The team had found a long Covid cohort to study—so it was time to take a closer look at their immune cells.",https://www.wired.com/story/long-covid-breathlessness-monocytes-symptoms/,,,,,,,,
5/5/2023 9:00,Gary Marcus Used to Call AI Stupid—Now He Calls It Dangerous,"AS A JOURNALIST, one thing I appreciate about Gary Marcus is that he always makes time for a chat. The last time we met face-to-face was late last year in New York City, where he fit me in between a series of press interviews, including NPR, CNN, the BBC, and the Big Kahuna, a taping of 60 Minutes with Leslie Stahl.

This is an edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

SUBSCRIBE to get access to Plaintext, a weekly newsletter on digital technology—who makes it and how it affects us.

When I called Marcus this week for an update on his Never Ending Tour to critique AI, he made sure to Zoom with me the next day, tweaking his schedule to avoid conflict with a Morning Joe hit. It was a good day for Marcus: the New York Times Sunday Magazine had just gone online with a lengthy Marcus interview conducted by its talk maven, David Marchese, whose previous subjects have included Thomas Piketty, Tom Stoppard, and Iggy Pop.

The success of large language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and a host of others has been so spectacular that it’s literally scary. This week President Biden summoned the lords of AI to figure out what to do about it. Even some of the people building models, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, recommend some form of regulation. And the discussion is a global one; Italy even banned OpenAI’s bot for a while.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

The sudden urgency about the benefits and evils of AI has made it a sufficiently hot media topic to create an instant demand for camera-ready experts—particularly those who have takes hot enough to sustain an extended sound bite. It is a moment made for Marcus, a 53-year-old entrepreneur and NYU professor emeritus who now lives in Vancouver, coincidentally the site of his recent TED talk on constraining AI. In addition to his inevitable Substack “The Road to A.I.  We Can Trust” and his podcast Humans vs. Machines—currently number 6 on Apple’s chart for tech pods—Marcus has ascended to become one of the go-to talking heads on this breakout topic, in such demand that one applauds his restraint in not creating a Marcus-bot so he could share his AI concerns with Andrew Ross Sorkin and Anderson Cooper at the same time. 

Marcus’ résumé makes him an unusual, though not unqualified, candidate as a spokes-expert in AI (though some people dispute his bona fides). For his 23 years at NYU, he was in psychology, not computer science. But he’s been fascinated with minds and machines since he was 8 years old and was sufficiently schooled in the topic to cofound an AI company called Geometric Intelligence. In 2016 he sold the firm to Uber, then for a short period became then-CEO Travis Kalanick’s AI czar, not a great credential for someone arguing for responsibility in the field. But Marcus didn’t stick around at Uber, and he later cofounded a robotics firm, Robust AI, which he left in 2021.

While pursuing his interests in AI, Marcus presented himself as a skeptic of what was becoming the dominant technology in the field—deep learning neural networks. He argued that collections of mathematical  nodes with weird black-box behavior were overrated and that there was still a critical role for old-school AI, based on reasoning and logic. At one point he publicly debated his fellow NYU professor Yann LeCun, a deep learning pioneer who is Meta’s chief AI scientist and a recent Turing Award recipient, on the subject. The debate was gentlemanly on both sides, but later, Marcus’ insistence that the accomplishments of deep learning were overrated led to gloves coming off and a sniping war between the two, conducted in part via Twitter. LeCun’s responses to Marcus’ jibes at deep learning generally expressed the view that Marcus doesn’t know what he’s talking about. “I don’t engage in vacuous debates,” LeCun once tweeted, after Marcus asked him to respond to some charge on deep learning’s limitations. “I build stuff. You should try it sometimes.” (LeCun demurred when invited to comment on Marcus for this column.)",https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-gary-marcus-ai-stupid-dangerous/,,,,,,,,

This pertains almost exclusively to my dress shirts; if they're not stinky or wrinkly, I might try to get an extra day or three out of them. I do love a nice crisp shirt, though, so when I heard about a portable steamer from the manufacturer of my favorite fancy iron, I was intrigued.

Actually, it gave me a lot of feelings, all at once. The Iggi by Laurastar is a surprisingly good-looking handheld appliance with a nail-polish red (or white) base. The one I called in to review is pleasingly sturdy, unlike much of its cheap plastic competition; Laurastar commits to 10 years of repairs under its generous warranty. Even the cord is pleasingly natty, with a woven fabric cover. It's about as close to an objet d'art as you can get in the fabric-straightening world.

Also unique in this realm is that it's pressurized. While many cheaper models are like little electric kettles that sorta exhale the steam in the general direction of your clothes, this one is quite different. Fill it up, plug it in, squeeze the trigger, and steam shoots a couple feet straight out. Then again, you pay for all this. The Iggi costs $300, whereas you can pick up an excellent floor-standing (non-travel) clothes steamer for less than that amount or buy a well-rated handheld steamer for as little as $20.

Still, when someone tosses you the keys to a sports car, you don’t stand around yapping about the finer points of carburetors. You hop in and punch it. I grabbed a shirt, built up a literal head of steam in the Iggi, squeezed the trigger, and FWOOOOOSHHH! It's pretty fun! You hang the garment in front of you, then gently pull the bottom of it with one hand while using the other to zap the wrinkles by slowly waving the device back and forth like a paint sprayer.

I quickly got the feeling that it worked better on some fabrics than on others. So I called an expert to understand why and how she uses steam.

“I steam everything. It's convenient. It makes you look like you care,” says clothing designer Shari Noble. She runs Seattle's La Macón label and helped me with that incredible iron a few years ago. “It might not be the same effect as when you're ironing, but it's close.”

Noble says she likes the steaming effect so much she'll even hit the inside of lined leather jackets, but she doesn't steam exclusively. She prefers to iron linen and finds that cotton comes out crisper that way, but she loves the steamer for silk, velvet, and wool. If it's a really delicate item, she'll steam from the inside, which she finds keeps the presentation side of the fabric in perfect shape.

""Just don't shoot yourself in the face,"" she counseled.

Duly warned, I got rolling. At the suggestion of WIRED colleague Medea Giordano, I picked up an inexpensive favorite steamer made by URPower, a company that also makes elevated dog bowls, car seat covers, and essential oil diffusers. It costs $20, or 15 times less than the Iggi, and is one of those “tiny electric kettle” style steamers.

5/5/2023 9:00,"AI, the WGA Strike, and What Luddites Got Right","THE MONITOR IS a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to Twitter.

Earlier this week, on the red (technically striped) carpet of the Met Gala, The Dropout star Amanda Seyfried answered a tough question: What did she think about the then-impending Writers Guild of America strike? Wearing an elegant Oscar de La Renta dress made with 80,000 gold and platinum bugle beads, she told a Variety reporter that everything she’d heard from writer friends indicated they would picket if they couldn’t reach an agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Poised, draped in priceless garments and jewels, she remained firm.

“I don’t get what the problem is,” she said. “Everything changed with streaming, and everybody needs to be compensated for their work. That’s fucking easy.”

Seyfried’s friends were right. At midnight that night, while many Met Gala attendees were still at after-parties, the WGA declared that the strike, the first of its kind in 15 years, was on. “The decision was made following six weeks of negotiating with @Netflix, @Amazon, @Apple, @Disney, @wbd, @NBCUniversal, @Paramountplus, and @Sony under the umbrella of the AMPTP,” the organization tweeted late Monday. “Though our Negotiating Committee began this process intent on making a fair deal, the studios’ responses have been wholly insufficient given the existential crisis writers are facing.”

Throughout the week, explainers have delved into what that crisis entails. For one, the 11,500 TV and film writers in the union were seeking more writers per show, shorter exclusive contracts, and better minimum pay—all conditions the guild says have gotten worse in the streaming era. For another, the union wants guardrails for Hollywood studios’ use of AI. 

Specifically, the Writers Guild is asking that their contract include language stipulating that every credited writer be a human person, that screenplays, treatments, outlines, and other “literary material,” in industry parlance, can’t be written by ChatGPT or its ilk. Also, they’re asking that AI not be used to generate source material or be trained on work created by WGA members. AMPTP responded by saying they’d be willing to have “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.”

Call someone a Luddite these days and they’ll think you’re saying they’re afraid of technological change. Actual Luddites, though, were nothing of the sort. In the middle of the Industrial Revolution, amid an economic downturn and growing unemployment, British textile workers began demanding better wages. Their form of protest was destroying the machines that automated their jobs. Many workers at the time worried about being replaced by technology, but that doesn’t mean the Luddites were totally against it. “They just wanted machines that made high-quality goods,” Kevin Binfield, editor of Writings of the Luddites, told Smithsonian Magazine in 2011, “and they wanted these machines to be run by workers who had gone through an apprenticeship and got paid decent wages.”",https://www.wired.com/story/wga-strike-artificial-intelligence-luddites/,,,,,,,,
5/5/2023 8:00,The Thorny Art of Deepfake Labeling,"LAST WEEK, THE Republican National Committee put out a video advertisement against Biden, which featured a small disclaimer in the top left of the frame: “Built entirely with AI imagery.” Critics questioned the diminished size of the disclaimer and suggested its limited value, particularly because the ad marks the first substantive use of AI in political attack advertising. As AI-generated media become more mainstream, many have argued that text-based labels, captions, and watermarks are crucial for transparency.

But do these labels actually work? Maybe not.

For a label to work, it needs to be legible. Is the text big enough to read? Are the words accessible? It should also provide audiences with meaningful context on how the media has been created and used. And in the best cases, it also discloses intent: Why has this piece of media been put into the world?

ABOUT

Katerina Cizek is the artistic director and research scientist at Co-Creation Studio at MIT Open Documentary Lab. She is the author (with Uricchio et al.) of Collective Wisdom, and a Peabody- and two-time Emmy-winning documentarian in the emergent tech and media space.

Journalism, documentary media, industry, and scientific publications have long relied on disclosures to provide audiences and users with the necessary context. Journalistic and documentary films generally use overlay text to cite sources. Warning labels and tags are ubiquitous on manufactured goods, foods, and drugs. In scientific reporting, it’s essential to disclose how data and analysis were captured. But labeling synthetic media, AI-generated content, and deepfakes is often seen as an unwelcome burden, especially on social media platforms. It’s a slapped-on afterthought. A boring compliance in an age of mis/disinformation.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

As such, many existing AI media disclosure practices, like watermarks and labels, can be easily removed. Even when they’re there, audience members’ eyes—now trained on rapid-fire visual input—seem to unsee watermarks and disclosures. For example, in September 2019, the well-known Italian satirical TV show Striscia la Notizia posted a low-fidelity face-swap video of former prime minister Matteo Renzi sitting at a desk insulting his then coalition partner Matteo Salvini with exaggerated hand gestures on social media. Despite a Striscia watermark and a clear text-based disclaimer, according to deepfakes researcher Henry Adjer, some viewers believed the video was genuine.

This is called context shift: Once any piece of media, even labeled and watermarked, is distributed across politicized and closed social media groups, its creators lose control of how it is framed, interpreted, and shared. As we found in a joint research study between Witness and MIT, when satire mixes with deepfakes it often creates confusion, as in the case of this Striscia video. These sorts of simple text-based labels can create the additional misconception that anything that doesn’t have a label is not manipulated, when in reality, that may not be true.

Technologists are working on ways to quickly and accurately trace the origins of synthetic media, like cryptographic provenance and detailed file metadata. When it comes to alternative labeling methods, artists and human rights activists are offering promising new ways to better identify this kind of content by reframing labeling as a creative act rather than an add-on.

When a disclosure is baked into the media itself, it can’t be removed, and it can actually be used as a tool to push audiences to understand how a piece of media was created and why. For example, in David France’s documentary Welcome to Chechnya, vulnerable interviewees were digitally disguised with the help of inventive synthetic media tools like those used to create deepfakes. In addition, subtle halos appeared around their faces, a clue for viewers that the images they were watching had been manipulated, and that these subjects were taking an immense risk in sharing their stories. And in Kendrick Lamar’s 2022 music video, “The Heart Part 5,” the directors used deepfake technology to transform Lamar’s face into both deceased and living celebrities such as Will Smith, O. J. Simpson, and Kobe Bryant. This use of technology is written directly into the lyrics of the song and choreography, like when Lamar uses his hand to swipe over his face, clearly indicating a deepfake edit. The resulting video is a meta-commentary on deepfakes themselves.",https://www.wired.com/story/the-thorny-art-of-deepfake-labeling/,,,,,,,,
,Yet Another Problem With Recycling: It Spews Microplastics,"THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY has long hyped recycling, even though it is well aware that it’s been a failure. Worldwide, only 9 percent of plastic waste actually gets recycled. In the United States, the rate is now 5 percent. Most used plastic is landfilled, incinerated, or winds up drifting around the environment. 

Now, an alarming new study has found that even when plastic makes it to a recycling center, it can still end up splintering into smaller bits that contaminate the air and water. This pilot study focused on a single new facility where plastics are sorted, shredded, and melted down into pellets. Along the way, the plastic is washed several times, sloughing off microplastic particles—fragments smaller than 5 millimeters—into the plant’s wastewater. 

Because there were multiple washes, the researchers could sample the water at four separate points along the production line. (They are not disclosing the identity of the facility’s operator, who cooperated with their project.) This plant was actually in the process of installing filters that could snag particles larger than 50 microns (a micron is a millionth of a meter), so the team was able to calculate the microplastic concentrations in raw versus filtered discharge water—basically a before-and-after snapshot of how effective filtration is.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Their microplastics tally was astronomical. Even with filtering, they calculate that the total discharge from the different washes could produce up to 75 billion particles per cubic meter of wastewater. Depending on the recycling facility, that liquid would ultimately get flushed into city water systems or the environment. In other words, recyclers trying to solve the plastics crisis may in fact be accidentally exacerbating the microplastics crisis, which is coating every corner of the environment with synthetic particles. 

“It seems a bit backward, almost, that we do plastic recycling in order to protect the environment, and then end up increasing a different and potentially more harmful problem,” says plastics scientist Erina Brown, who led the research while at the University of Strathclyde. 

“It raises some very serious concerns,” agrees Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics and a former US Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “And I also think this points to the fact that plastics are fundamentally not sustainable.”",https://www.wired.com/story/yet-another-problem-with-recycling-it-spews-microplastics/,,,,,,,,
5/5/2023 7:00,Motorola’s Moto G Power 5G Lags Behind the Competition,"EVERY YEAR, I get more and more confused with Motorola's Moto G series of smartphones. The company has been churning out these budget phones for a decade. Originally, there was a simple progression system: The Moto G was followed by a Moto G (2nd Gen), then by a Moto G (3rd Gen). Then the company started introducing variants, from a Moto G5 Plus to a Moto G6 Play, which was still logical.

Now, the 2023 lineup consists of five devices: the Moto G Play, Moto G 5G, Moto G Stylus, and the Moto G Power 5G. Oh, and don't confuse any of those with the 2022 models, many of which have the same name. I was in the middle of testing the new Moto G Power 5G ($300) when the company announced the new Moto G Stylus ($200) and Moto G 5G ($250), all launching this month. That puts this handset toward the top of the lineup. While the Power is more or less functional, there are some questionable choices that make it hard to wholeheartedly recommend, not to mention the other great options at this price.

Power Up

The number-one improvement in this phone over its predecessor is performance. Due to a lackluster processor, the Moto G Power 2022 bizarrely delivered a more laggy experience than the Power that came before, but the company has remedied this. The new Moto G Power 5G 2023 has the MediaTek Dimensity 930 with 6 gigabytes of RAM, and my benchmark tests show a leap—this is one of the best-performing Moto G phones to date.

I've not had issues using this phone for almost all of my daily tasks, whether I'm sending my partner a funny meme from Reddit, trying to maintain my Duolingo streak minutes before midnight, or playing a quick game of Dead Cells on the train. That's not to say you won't see stutters. They're fairly common actually, but there's no cripplingly frustrating performance here. It's only when you need to quickly juggle multiple apps that you might feel a twinge of annoyance.

Arguably even better is battery life. I was able to eke out two full days of average use with the 5,000-mAh cell, par for the course on most Moto G handsets, though it's not as great as the three-day battery life on the 2020 model. But hey, I'll take anything over a single day of juice.

PHOTOGRAPH: MOTOROLA

There's a 6.5-inch LCD screen here, and my big paws find it mostly OK to use with one hand, but it's definitely a two-hander for most people. I didn’t find too many faults with the screen. It's sharp (1080p), reasonably colorful, and bright enough to read on sunny days (some squinting required). It gets a little dim when viewed at an angle. While it's nice that there's a 120-Hz screen refresh rate to make all interactions feel fluid, the everyday stutters you'll see when scrolling apps like Reddit or Twitter kinda kill the effect.

I'm going to fire off a few perks, even though there's a good chance you might not care about them at all. First, there's a headphone jack for the anti-wireless crowd. There's sub-6 5G support, and I had no issues connecting to AT&T's service in New York. There's 256 GB of internal storage—kudos to Motorola for actually increasing this; most flagship phones still start at 128 gigs—and a microSD card slot in case you want to expand it even more. There's a reliable capacitive fingerprint scanner embedded in the power button, and this phone runs the latest Android 13 operating system. Oh, and there's a charger included in the box.

5/5/2023 2:00,The Seabed Empire Funding Britain’s New King,"REGENT STREET IS one of the most iconic shopping destinations in the world. The grand, curving street is home to Apple’s flagship store, as well as storied London shops like Liberty and Hamleys. And almost all of it belongs to King Charles III. Or, to be more precise, the Crown Estate—the commercial real estate business that owns and manages vast swaths of land and property belonging to the British monarch.

The Crown Estate’s property empire includes Twitter’s London HQ, multiple shopping centers, and the Ascot racecourse, but its dominion extends well beyond the shores of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Since 1964, the Crown Estate has laid claim to the UK’s entire continental shelf, reaching hundreds of kilometers into the sea, and with it the right to grant permissions to build offshore wind turbines, lay pipelines, and store carbon under the seabed.

For years, the seabed was a sideshow to the royal family’s sprawling terrestrial property empire. But over the past few years it’s leapt in value, as a result of the booming market for renewable energy. After rising incrementally for years, the value of the seabed doubled between 2020 and 2021. By 2022, the Crown Estate estimated its marine portfolio was worth £5 billion ($6.3 billion).

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Globally, there has been a dramatic acceleration in ocean-based industries, with the OECD projecting that the ocean economy could exceed $3 trillion by 2030. But the UK, with its 29,000 kilometers of coastline, has been an early mover in commercializing its coastal waters beyond the traditional sectors of oil and gas, seafood, and shipping. The Crown Estate has facilitated and profited from much of this new activity, working in tandem with the government to rent out areas of ocean to companies that want to install offshore wind turbines, dredge up sand and gravel for the construction industry, lay cables for internet traffic and electricity, or build pipelines for oil and gas. It’s also responsible for handing out the rights to store carbon—a potentially lucrative future industry.

Not all the money generated by the seabed around England, Wales, and Northern Ireland funds the royals. A quarter of the Crown Estate’s profits goes to the British monarchy via a system called the sovereign grant, while the rest flows into the public purse through the finance ministry. Scotland has a different system, where the government takes 100 percent of the profits generated by the Crown Estate Scotland, a separate entity. But as King Charles officially takes the throne on Saturday, the monarch will preside over a royal family that is partly funded by a new era of ocean industry.

During King Charles’ tenure, Crown Estate commissioners will make decisions that will permanently change Britain’s seabed—choosing which companies and industries get priority in an increasingly busy sea. Already, the high cost of leasing the seabed to develop offshore wind projects is shutting small companies out of the process. And as competition to store carbon under the sea heats up, there is a danger that the new seabed economy will look disturbingly similar to the old one, with a handful of oil and gas giants dominating and locking in a future based on fossil fuels.",https://www.wired.com/story/britain-crown-estate-ocean-empire/,,,,,,,,

The Original Star Wars Trilogy

Naturally, Star Wars is one of the big attractions on Disney+. And it goes without saying, or at least it should, that the films that comprise the original trilogy are the best of the bunch—and the only Star Wars movies you should watch if you’re opting not to binge all dozen or so features. The caveat for pickier fans is that these are the versions that have been messed with by George Lucas post-release. Some things, like the improved visuals in and around Cloud City, are thoughtful additions, but others are more controversial.

The Star Wars Prequel Trilogy

More than 20 years after Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope (aka simply Star Wars) helped to define the Hollywood blockbuster, George Lucas returned to the space opera well with an all-new trilogy for an all-new generation of moviegoers. It went about as well as you’d expect. We won’t pretend that The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and/or Revenge of the Sith (2005) have even an ounce of the heart, humor, or heroism of the original films. But they’ve become essential pop culture viewing, and a rite of passage for sci-fi fans, if only to get what all the Jar Jar Binks hate is about.

The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy

When Disney purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012, it was essentially George Lucas handing over the keys to the Millennium Falcon. While fans were rightly skeptical about whether the Mouse House would be able—or even want—to recapture the slightly countercultural environment in which the series was originally created, one hopeful thought united them all: Whatever Disney concocted could not be worse than the Prequel Trilogy. And they were right. By giving the reins to J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens), Rian Johnson (The Last Jedi), then Abrams once again (The Rise of Skywalker), the series became more of a love letter to the original films and the generations of filmmakers—and fans—they inspired. Happily, actors Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver proved worthy successors to the smugglers, scavengers, Jedi masters, and Sith Lords who preceded them.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever

As WIRED senior writer Jason Parham wrote in his review of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, this movie his haunted by the absence of Chadwick Boseman, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's original King T’Challa who died following a battle with colon cancer in 2020. To that end, writer-director Ryan Coogler had to make a much different kind of superhero film, one that addressed the loss of its main character while also pushing Marvel's cinematic storyline forward into its next phase. “It's rare for MCU films to channel the turbulence of grief with such unflinching focus,” Parham wrote. “Coogler has equipped his sequel with a changed vocabulary: It speaks equally from a place of loss as it does triumph. Grief is its mother tongue.” To that end, the director uses the death of T'Challa to usher in a new Black Panther as well as new heroes (Ironheart) and adversaries-turned-allies (Namor).

Abbey Road Studios is best known as the place where the Beatles recorded some of their most iconic albums, including 1969’s Abbey Road. But the hallowed halls of this legendary music studio have played a much bigger role in the music industry, as it has hosted the likes of everyone from Elton John, Pink Floyd, and Aretha Franklin to Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Radiohead, Adele, Oasis, Kate Bush, and Frank Ocean. This documentary, which comes on the heels of Peter Jackson’s docuseries The Beatles: Get Back (which is also streaming on Disney+ and is highly recommended), is directed by Mary McCartney—daughter of Sir Paul—who practically grew up in the studio and, as such, is able to treat her subject with the reverence it deserves.

Avatar

James Cameron’s Avatar was all anyone could talk about when it was released in theaters in 2009 and promptly went on to make more than $1 billion, becoming the cinematic iceberg that sank another Cameron epic, 1997’s Titanic, from its place as the highest-grossing movie of all time. For a movie that made so much bank, it never occupied a huge space in the cultural conversation about movies. Like so many of Cameron’s works, much of its innovation came from the technology that essentially had to be invented to make it possible. And while the original film was unexpectedly yanked from streaming back in September, when it made a surprise reappearance in theaters, it’s finally back on Disney+, ready to treat audiences to the world of Pandora all over again. While fans had hoped that the movie’s long-awaited sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water, would make its way to Disney+ not too long after its release last December, it’s still not on the streaming service yet. And rumors are flying that audiences might need to wait a while for that.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness

Sam Raimi’s sequel to 2016’s Doctor Strange isn’t the beloved director’s first superhero movie, but it is his first foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe style of making movies, which ultimately proves to be both a blessing and a curse. On the plus side, the movie is probably the closest thing the Marvel franchise has gotten to a straight-up horror film, and it’s full of Raimi’s signature practical effects (plus the ever-important Bruce Campbell cameo). Yet, because the MCU is such a box office powerhouse, the movie never goes full Raimi—which is understandable, but somewhat disappointing for fans of The Evil Dead maestro. Still, it’s ultimately a fun ride with multiple versions of Benedict Cumberbatch’s cocky Doctor and Elizabeth Olsen as the power-seeking Scarlet Witch.

The MCU has produced more than two dozen films since 2008, yet the very first of them—Iron Man—remains one of the best. It’s almost hard to believe how hard director Jon Favreau had to fight to get Robert Downey Jr. the leading role, as he’s arguably one of the MCU’s most beloved figures. Before there was a whole franchise plus a shared TV universe, Downey, as Tony Stark/Iron Man, was just allowed to do his thing. It was a gamble that paid off for all involved.

West Side Story

From Martin Scorsese to Spike Lee, pretty much every great director has made—or at least tried to make—a grand Hollywood musical, perhaps one of the toughest genres to successfully pull off. Steven Spielberg made the task even more difficult when he decided to adapt Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, and ​​Arthur Laurents’ West Side Story—which Robert Wise already did to great acclaim in 1961. But, Spielberg (being Spielberg) managed to create an updated take on the story of Tony (Ansel Elgort) and Maria (Rachel Zegler), two love-struck teens caught in the middle of an escalating rivalry between two street gangs, the Sharks and the Jets. The update gives nods to the original (like casting Rita Moreno, who won an Oscar for her role as Anita in Wise’s film) while improving on some of its controversial aspects (like casting Natalie Wood in the role of a Puerto Rican teen).

Put aside the rather vulgar stereotypes that were common at the time (the movie now comes with a warning) and Lady and the Tramp remains one of the most iconic Disney animations, and a love story for the ages. When a spoiled cocker spaniel named Lady finds herself competing with a new baby for the attention of her parents, she ends up getting loose and befriending a mangy but charming mutt named Tramp. Ultimately, Lady needs to choose the pampered life she’s always known with Jim Dear and Darling, or a life of spaghetti dinner discards with the hopelessly romantic Tramp—unless there’s another way.

Eighteen days later the team was rescued, with all 12 boys and their coach surviving the incident.

Marvel's biggest mistake in the entire MCU canon (so far) was not commissioning Captain Marvel sooner. The film, set in the past, sees the rise of Marvel (Brie Larson) as she discovers her origin story and develops her powers. The film, the first entry in the Marvel universe with a female lead, channels the spirit of the 1990s both in its setting and in style, with heaping spoonfuls of Samuel L. Jackson and all the plot and subtlety of a blockbuster action movie. Larson adds a healthy dose of sarcasm to undercut her character’s immense power, and Jackson is eerily brilliant, making for a super fun 123 minutes.

In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and its shutdown of almost the entire movie industry, Disney decided to try something new with its live-action version of Mulan by making it available to Disney+ subscribers instead of releasing it in theaters. The film itself is one of the latest in Disney’s recent string of live-action remakes and sees Liu Yifei in the title role, with reviews praising the cast, visuals, and action sequences.

Avengers: Endgame

There's a moment in the event-movie-to-endgame-all-event-movies when you realize that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have gone full Harry Potter and the Cursed Child all over the MCU. Once you get past the rather glum beginning, you can settle in for what you have come to expect from any Avengers movie: Tony Stark cracking wise; Doctor Strange doing weird things with his hands; Professor Hulk explaining the science of what’s going on; and Black Widow and Captain Marvel kicking ass, both emotionally and physically. It's a messy but epic baton-pass in the form of an angsty portal-powered mega-battle. And we're not going to lie: We've watched those audience reaction videos, and they too are a thing of joy.

Togo

The year is 1925 and a deadly epidemic has struck the Alaskan town of Nome. The only cure is 600 miles away, and a massive storm is about to strike the region. Leonhard Seppala and his lead sled dog, Togo, are the town’s only hope of getting the vaccine. The dog may not be the biggest of the sled crew, but it is tenacious. The entire mission to save the town relies on Togo’s ability to face the challenging conditions. Added to all that, Togo is based on a true story.

Deadpool 2

This foul-mouthed superhero movie marks a definite departure from the vanilla content that was available on Disney+ in its first couple years of operation. Ryan Reynolds plays Deadpool, who has the ability to heal from pretty much any injury—and is an angry, violent, wisecracking mercenary tasked with protecting a young mutant from a time-traveling soldier.

Hamilton

If you only know Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical from the obscenely high ticket prices and snippets of the soundtrack, here’s your chance to find out what all the fuss is about. A version of the production, recorded via a six-camera setup over two performances by the original Broadway cast, was put on Disney+ after plans to release it in cinemas were scrapped. Aside from a couple of censored swear words and the fact that it's directed (by Thomas Kail), it's essentially the same show—an energetic, empathetic, witty, quippy hip-hop musical about US founding father Alexander Hamilton.

Now's the time for a Pixar short sesh. You could do as the studio intended and pick out the correct short to watch before the main animated showing, or you could head to the Shorts tab and go wild with Pixar, Disney, and new Sparkshorts. WIRED's faves are Lava (8 minutes), Bao (7 minutes), Purl (12 minutes), Smash and Grab (8 minutes), La Luna (6 minutes), Sanjay's Super Team (7 minutes), and Day and Night (7 minutes). Out (9 minutes) is one of the latest, and for a slice of Pixar history, check out 1997's Geri's Game (4 minutes) and see if you recognize the chess player.

Moana

One of the potential answers to “What, oh, what to put on after Frozen and Frozen 2?” Moana is in fact better than Frozen. By that we simply mean better soundtrack, better heroine, better visuals, and better side quests. There's also 100 percent more Dwayne Johnson as a tattooed demigod and Jemaine Clement as a giant crab doing a Bowie impression. Set thousands of years ago on the fictional, Polynesia-inspired island of Motunui, Moana's hero's journey is fairly classic, but the sumptuous animation and Lin-Manuel Miranda tunes are top-tier Disney. (Sure, we'd love to see Taika Waititi's original script, but we can live without it.)

Free Solo

If your friend told you they'd decided to solo-climb up the sheer 3,000-foot granite El Capitan wall in Yosemite, California, with no rope, you’d think they had gone mad. But that’s exactly what Alex Honnold set out to do back in 2017. Honnold’s quest to climb the vertical wall was documented by his two director friends, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, as he took on the ascent to become the world’s first person to free-climb El Capitan. But it’s not just about the ascent, it’s also about Honnold’s complicated life, his emotional issues, and all the things that have driven him to pursue one of the most dangerous missions ever attempted by any free climber. The cinematography in Free Solo is also dizzyingly beautiful, and the entire thing will have you gripping the arm of your chair in terror.

Honey, I Shrunk The Kids

Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is an experimental inventor who creates an electromagnetic shrinking machine. Naturally, he accidentally shrinks his own children (if you didn’t already guess that from the title), plus the kids from next door, then unwittingly throws them in the trash. To have any chance of becoming their normal size again, the teeny tots must navigate their way across the family's (now seemingly gigantic) yard and back to the house. It's something fraught with peril when you're half the size of an aspirin.

Toy Story (All of Them)

While it might have seemed that Pixar could never make anything as good as the original 1995 Toy Story, each of the three subsequent films add depth to the franchise's canon. All of the movies are critically acclaimed—and they're all available on Disney+. When combined, the four films tell a story about growing up and how everything in life, inevitably, changes. Woody (Tom Hanks) and the gang go from learning how to deal with new people to understanding loss. It's something that's also followed the cast: In Toy Story 4, the voice of Mr. Potato Head was created through archive recordings after Don Rickles, as the man behind the voice, died ahead of the film's release.

The Lion King

Remember the terrifying wildebeest stampede in the 1994 version of The Lion King? That was actually computer animated, because drawing them by hand would have taken a long, long time. Special attention was taken to blend it into the cel-shaded backgrounds, and this was all before Toy Story came out the following year. Which is all to say that not only is the '90s version a perfect movie that had absolutely zero need for a charm-deficient 2019 remake (which is also streaming on Disney+ in case you want to compare), it’s also the best Lion King to use CG animation.

10 Things I Hate About You

Heath Ledger singing “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” on the bleachers. That’s the iconic scene in this top-caliber high school romcom. The plot is taken from The Taming of the Shrew, the cast—including Ledger, Julia Stiles, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt—are all adorable, and the late '90s nostalgia is potent. Offering some much-needed variety from the sci-fi and animation that dominates the Disney+ launch catalog, 10 Things I Hate About You is as good as comfort-food movies get.

WATCH ON DISNEY+
Tron & Tron: Legacy

Tron and its modern sequel, Tron: Legacy, aren't your typical Disney films. The original sees a programmer (Jeff Bridges) become trapped inside a computer system where he meets and befriends programs, including the eponymous hero Tron, who are resisting the power of a growing artificial intelligence, the Master Control Program. It became a sci-fi cult classic, leading to the creation of a modern sequel that continues the story and features an epic score cowritten by Daft Punk. Both are watchable distractions, even if the sequel feels a little thin in places.

WATCH ON DISNEY+
Willow

Another nostalgia fest, this time for fans of '80s fantasy. Willow is a family-friendly, mythic quest that’s best seen as George Lucas and Ron Howard’s fun, $35 million Tolkien fan fiction. The story of a farmer tasked with protecting a magic baby from an evil queen is not exactly the most original story in the world, but that hasn’t stopped this from becoming a classic, with Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood and Val Kilmer waving a sword around. Classic Sunday afternoon fare.

Wreck-It Ralph

This sugary sweet animation tells the story of Ralph, a villain from an 1980s arcade game who wants to be something more than just the bad guy throwing debris off the top of an 8-bit building. One day, he goes AWOL from his game and ventures into the wider arcade—encountering a mish-mash of video game characters loosely based on your childhood favorites—from Hero’s Duty (a combination of Halo and Call of Duty, so basically Gears of War) to Sugar Rush (a weird mash-up of Mario Kart and Candy Crush), where he strikes up a friendship with a young girl racer.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier

Winter Soldier is among the best Marvel movies. It makes time for quieter character moments, and the action, while still spectacular, feels a little more grounded and real than the CGI-fueled shock and awe of the mainline movies. In this outing, Captain America faces off against a rogue element of SHIELD led by Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce.

WATCH ON DISNEY+
Thor: Ragnarok

The first two Thor films were among the worst in the whole series—Chris Hemsworth’s thunder god was dour and charmless. But here, director Taika Waititi injected some much-needed color into the proceedings, borrowing heavily from the Planet Hulk storyline from the comics. Thor finds himself stranded on a bizarre planet, ruled over by Jeff Goldblum (who is pretty much playing himself). There, he crosses paths with Bruce Banner’s Hulk, who has been missing since the events of Civil War. It’s hugely funny, and arguably the best film of the series, which now includes this summer’s Thor: Love and Thunder.

WATCH ON DISNEY+
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story

The newer Star Wars one-off films attract strong opinions, and Rogue One is no different. But while it has its issues, it fills an important hole in the universe and features some of the best action sequences in the entire saga. Its main black mark is the rather iffy CGI recreation of Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin, but it's still a fun romp that lacks the narrative baggage of the new trilogy.

WATCH ON DISNEY+
Black Panther

Black Panther had a huge cultural impact. It was refreshingly unusual to see a blockbuster superhero film with such a diverse cast—and the Afrofuturist setting was unlike anything Marvel had ever done before. Michael B. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger, who returns to his father’s home to claim the throne from T’Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman).

WATCH ON DISNEY+
WALL·E

Released in 2008, a time when, for many, the climate crisis felt like a distant, abstract threat, WALL·E is classic Pixar. It’s a love story—sort of—that focuses on two robots. But it’s also a story about survival, believing in yourself, and dancing through the vacuum of space propelled by a fire extinguisher. The animation, especially on the desolate, barren Earth, is a sight to behold. The opening scenes of the film are also basically a silent film, with the score and robotic sound effects doing a fantastic job bringing out the emotion and drama of what’s happening.

WATCH ON DISNEY+
Peter Pan & Wendy

Between Pete’s Dragon (2016) and The Green Knight (2021), David Lowery has mastered the art of reimagining stories you’ve seen told hundreds of times in completely new and original ways. This straight-to-Disney+ live-action adaptation of J. M. Barrie’s Peter Pan is yet another example of this very specific kind of talent, even if a large part of its purpose seems to be to erase the racist elements that existed in the classic Disney cartoon. The boy who refused to grow up (here, played by Alexander Molony) never felt so of-the-moment.

WATCH ON DISNEY+
Inside Out

Don’t cry. But also cry. A lot. Inside Out is the perfect realization of what every Pixar film strives to achieve. On the surface, it’s a comedic look at human emotion, the complexity of a child growing up, and the delicate balance of family life. But by literally getting inside the head of 11-year-old Riley, the film finds a way to bring emotion to life in a way that is at once comedic, profound, and often ingenious.

WATCH ON DISNEY+
Up

Pixar's Up can claim one of the most moving opening scenes of any movie. Despite being released more than a decade ago, in 2009, the animation hasn't aged or lost any of its charm. In a little over 90 minutes, director Pete Docter takes us on the journey of Carl, an old widower who is seeking out Paradise Falls. Carl's trip in his flying house is made in memory of his wife, Ellie, who had always wanted to visit the falls. The film won two Oscars—Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score—but was also nominated for three more. These included Best Picture, which at the time made it only the second animated film to have received the nomination (1991’s Beauty and the Beast was the first).

WATCH ON DISNEY+
The Straight Story

David Lynch has built a career on being wonderfully bizarre and surreal. But the strangest thing he might have ever done was to make this G-rated family drama for Disney, which seemed to fly way under the radar. Richard Farnsworth earned a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination for his role as stubborn—and ailing—old man Alvin Straight, who decides to reconnect with his estranged brother (Harry Dean Stanton) after a decade of not speaking. So Alvin hits the road, on his riding lawn mower, to make the 300-mile journey.

The Jungle Book

Whatever mood you're in, Disney+ has The Jungle Book to suit it. The streaming service has both the 1967 animated classic, with its catchy soundtrack and moments of humor, plus the live-action version released in 2016. The two films couldn't be more different. If you want to go for full family entertainment, pick the original, but if you're after something a little darker, the modern remake is where you should head. (Bonus fact: The entire live-action film was shot in a warehouse.)

Guardians of the Galaxy

The first volume of Guardians of the Galaxy didn't burst into the MCU until 2014, which is relatively late considering Phase One began with Iron Man in 2008. However, it's become a firm fan favorite, providing some of the Universe's most memorable (and important) characters. Quill, Rocket, Groot, Gamora, and Nebula are all distinctive and in many ways more likable than other key MCU characters. Guardians is worth returning to if you want to remember a slightly simpler time before Thanos' snap.

5/4/2023 14:16,Google Is Making a Folding Phone,"
It may feel like Twitter is slowly imploding, but the platform is still a good place to go for breaking news. Case in point: On Thursday, Google teased its latest hardware device in a tweet. It's a folding Pixel phone.

Twitter content

This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

The phone is called the Pixel Fold, and that's pretty much all we know about it for sure. The company says it will reveal more details on the device during the keynote address of Google IO, its annual developer conference, which takes place in Mountain View, California, on Wednesday, May 10.

There are a few things we can discern about the Pixel Fold just from the photo and short video that Google released. The same images appear on the Google Store on a page that presumably will become the product page where the phone can be purchased when it goes on sale.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

It folds book-style, like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold, not clamshell-style like the Z Flip or Motorola's Razr redux. Also, strikingly, the Pixel Fold appears to have a full-size screen on the front. Many folding phones that collapse like a book use a smaller screen on the front, but the Pixel Fold goes big, with an edge-to-edge screen like the ones found on regular, nonfolding smartphones.

VIDEO: GOOGLE

The Pixel Fold's interior screen doesn't appear to go edge-to-edge, but instead is nestled within a slim black bezel. On that folding screen, we can see some Android widgets and user interface elements that look as though they've been optimized for the larger folding screen. No doubt, when the Pixel Fold is revealed, the adaptive Android elements will be a big part of the demonstration.

There are some chrome accents on the edges that are reminiscent of the Pro-level Pixel models and some recent flagship-level Samsung Galaxy devices. There's also a chrome finish applied to the camera bump on the back of the phone. (Chrome accents on a phone always remind me of the Ford Crown Victoria, and I wish companies would stop doing this, because who wants to be reminded of a Crown Vic eight dozen times a day? But I digress.) These accents signal that the Pixel Fold will be a premium device. 

They also signal a very high price. Google has said nothing about the price—or anything else really, other than showing the images and re-upping the date of the IO keynote—but we can assume this foldy will come with a price tag considerably higher than the non-folding Pixels.

Google's news about a premium, folding smartphone comes at a time when smartphone sales are in a deep slump. Also, consumers have not responded to folding devices as enthusiastically as the smartphone makers experimenting with the form factor have hoped they would. Maybe the arrival of a folding phone made by the same company that makes the software running on it—the “whole stack” approach—will be the nudge that gets this still awkward hardware design out of its niche and into the mainstream.",https://www.wired.com/story/pixel-fold-specs-details-release-date/,,,,,,,,
5/4/2023 14:04,The Harmful Side Effect of Cleaning Up the Ocean,"IN THE NORTHERN Pacific Ocean, two sky-blue ships are sailing parallel to one another, several hundred meters apart. Pulled behind them is a giant U-shaped barrier, which almost looks like a fishing net. You could be forgiven for thinking they are trawlers. But they’re aiming to catch something else: plastic.

The Ocean Cleanup (TOC) is the world’s largest organization working to remove floating plastic from the ocean. Since 2021, the nonprofit has recovered 200 tons of plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an area between California and Hawaii that is notorious for its floating waste, which is concentrated there by ocean currents. In this area, which is roughly three times the size of France, at least 400 times the amount of plastic extracted by TOC remains, to which more is added every day as it is discarded from boats or flows into the sea from rivers.

To Boyan Slat, the founder of TOC, this cleanup work “signifies an age in which we’re starting to correct the problems we ourselves have created.” To TOC’s critics, the project is costly and inefficient—a distraction from the root of the problem, which is too much plastic being discarded and not enough preventing it from getting into the sea. But more recently, new charges have been laid at the door of TOC: that its cleanup efforts are capturing not only plastic but also sea creatures that live among it. That they are, essentially, disrupting a marine habitat.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

According to a new study, floating marine life, known as “neuston,” often ends up in the same places as plastic. It’s not that the plastic is somehow creating an opportunity for life to emerge, says marine biologist and corresponding author Rebecca Helm, but rather that plastic debris and organisms tend to float up and clump together in water, like cereal in a bowl. Add to this wind and swirling ocean currents, which bring plastic and neuston in from afar, and “patches” form.

Back in 2019, a rare occurrence allowed Helm, who is an assistant professor at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, to study the contents of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. A sailing crew accompanied long-distance swimmer Benoît Lecomte as he swam right through the patch. Behind them they towed a small net along the surface of the water every day to take samples of floating marine life and plastic debris. They did the same in the periphery and outside the patch for comparison. They then photographed 22 of these samples.

Working with colleagues at the University of Hull in the UK, Helm then set about analyzing them, using image-processing software to flag different kinds of neustonic species and plastic debris in the photos. The team found that concentrations of both plastic and neuston were higher inside the patch than outside. Jellyfish-like species known as by-the-wind sailors and blue buttons were particularly visible. So too were violet snails.

It was far from a perfect method. Twenty-two photos is not a lot, and an examination of the actual samples rather than pictures of them would have been more rigorous. Plus, using “surface tows” to sample the ocean’s contents “is an imperfect art,” says Helm. Sometimes the net bounces above the waves, other times it goes below, missing some water and the plastic and organisms floating in it. But, she adds, it’s pretty clear from the photos that there’s a lot of neuston present in the garbage patch.",https://www.wired.com/story/ocean-cleanup-habitat-destruction/,,,,,,,,

This is a brand-new 3D phone grip that complements the previously released Darth Vader and Stormtrooper editions.

,These ChatGPT Rivals Are Designed to Play With Your Emotions,"CHATGPT AND ITS brethren are both surprisingly clever and disappointingly dumb. Sure, they can generate pretty poems, solve scientific puzzles, and debug spaghetti code. But we know that they often fabricate, forget, and act like weirdos.

This is an edition of WIRED's Fast Forward newsletter, a weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring AI advances and other technology set to change our lives.

Inflection AI, a company founded by researchers who previously worked on major artificial intelligence projects at Google, OpenAI, and Nvidia, built a bot called Pi that seems to make fewer blunders and be more adept at sociable conversation.

Inflection designed Pi to address some of the problems of today’s chatbots. Programs like ChatGPT use artificial neural networks that try to predict which words should follow a chunk of text, such as an answer to a user’s question. With enough training on billions of lines of text written by humans, backed by high-powered computers, these models are able to come up with coherent and relevant responses that feel like a real conversation. But they also make stuff up and go off the rails.

Mustafa Suleyman, Inflection’s CEO, says the company has carefully curated Pi’s training data to reduce the chance of toxic language creeping into its responses. “We're quite selective about what goes into the model,” he says. “We do take a lot of information that’s available on the open web, but not absolutely everything.”

Suleyman, who cofounded the AI company Deepmind, which is now part of Google, also says that limiting the length of Pi’s replies reduces—but does not wholly eliminate—the likelihood of factual errors.

Based on my own time chatting with Pi, the result is engaging, if more limited and less useful than ChatGPT and Bard. Those chatbots became better at answering questions through additional training in which humans assessed the quality of their  responses. That feedback is used to steer the bots toward more satisfying responses. 

Suleyman says Pi was trained in a similar way, but with an emphasis on being friendly and supportive—though without  a human-like personality, which could confuse users about the program’s capabilities. Chatbots that take on a human persona have already proven problematic. Last year, a Google engineer controversially claimed that the company’s AI model LaMDA, one of the first programs to demonstrate how clever and engaging large AI language models could be, might be sentient. ",https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-chatgpt-rivals-emotions/,,,,,,,,
5/4/2023 10:00,"The Bags, Backpacks, Cubes, and Straps to Protect Your Camera","THE PERFECT CAMERA bag doesn't exist. I once spent two hours in a B&H store trying to fit all of my photo gear inside more than 20 bags the store had on sale, and I still left unsatisfied. Everyone's needs are different, and what works for me might not work for you. But to make your search easier, the camera enthusiasts on the WIRED Gear team have tested nearly 70 bags to help whittle down the choices. We've shoved our equipment into slings, messenger bags, backpacks, and cubes—we've even gone bag-free—all in search of a convenient way to carry everything while keeping it protected and lightweight. These are our favorite picks.

5/4/2023 9:00,The Best Coffee Subscriptions We’ve Savored,"A CUP OF coffee in the morning is not just about the caffeine (though that's certainly important). It's the ritual that starts the day. There's the whir of beans grinding, the toasted smell as it brews—even waiting for your finished cup is a part of the fun. It's time to start creeping toward wakefulness, like the sun peeking over the horizon in an old-timey Folgers commercial—all fuzzy and warm and full of promise. Unless, that is, you're out of coffee. Then it's dull, gray, and cold. One way to protect yourself from this desolation is to pick up a coffee subscription.

We've tested several coffee subscription services over the past couple of years, and they're a great way to keep yourself stocked up. Like the Netflix of old that sent DVDs, these companies mail you coffee beans at regular intervals. Some specialize in highlighting small roasters, while others source and roast their own beans. Below, we've listed what we like and dislike about each.

Updated May 2023: We've added Tostado Coffee, Partners Coffee, and Birds & Beans Coffee.

Trade Coffee Subscription
$16 AT TRADE (10 OZ)

Trade Coffee's specialty is bringing coffee from small roasters to the forefront. The company doesn't roast its own beans; it partners with roasters and makes it simple for you to get beans from boutique roasters around the US.

FEATURED VIDEO

 

Trade Coffee has everything you want from a coffee subscription, including a simple questionnaire to help match your tastes to its coffees, and a helpful website to browse new coffee and make notes about coffees you like (or don't). Trade's selection is huge, too. At the time of writing, there are more than 400 possibilities to choose from (this is why the smart questionnaire is so helpful), and the selection is split pretty evenly between blends and single-origin options. Trade also has a decaf option, which makes it one of the few subscription services to offer it—an important step toward being more inclusive. 

Delivery options: One, two, three, four, or six weeks

For the Fastest, Freshest Delivery

Blue Bottle Coffee
$13 AT BLUE BOTTLE (12 OZ)

Blue Bottle is one of the older coffee subscriptions. It's still great, though its selection is not as extensive as some of the newcomers. Where Blue Bottle stands out is freshness—the company promises to ship your coffee within 24 hours of roasting.

Blue Bottle has a 10-question survey it uses to pair you with coffee you'll love. Its questions aren't just about coffee; they ask about your favorite chocolate and even salad dressing. It might seem odd, but it works. WIRED senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson got excellent pairings that were among the best coffee he's tried for this guide. Blue Bottle also has a decaf option. ",https://www.wired.com/story/best-coffee-subscriptions/,,,,,,,,
5/4/2023 9:00,Land Ownership Makes No Sense,"“THERE’S NO SUCH thing as a good landlord” is a rallying cry of angry renters. In the future, it might be conventional morality that it’s simply wrong to own land.

In our times, owning land seems as natural as owning cars or houses. And this makes sense: The general presumption is that you can privately own anything, with rare exceptions for items such as dangerous weapons or archaeological artifacts. The idea of controlling territory, specifically, has a long tenure. Animals, warlords, and governments all do it, and the modern conception of “fee simple”—that is, unrestricted, perpetual, and private—land ownership has existed in English common law since the 13th century.

NEXT NORMAL
This is part of Next Normal, WIRED's series on the future of morality and how our ethical beliefs may change in the years to come.

Yet by 1797, US founding father Thomas Paine was arguing that “the earth, in its natural uncultivated state” would always be “the common property of the human race,"" and so landowners owed non-landowners compensation “for the loss of his or her natural inheritance.” 

FEATURED VIDEO

 

A century later, economist Henry George saw that poverty was rising despite increasing wealth and blamed this on our system of owning land. He proposed that land should be taxed at up to 100 percent of its “unimproved” value—we’ll get to that in a moment—allowing other forms of taxes (certainly including property taxes, but also potentially income taxes) to be reduced or abolished. George became a sensation. His book Progress and Poverty sold 2 million copies, and he got 31 percent of the vote in the 1886 New York mayoral race (finishing second, narrowly ahead of a 31-year-old Teddy Roosevelt).

George was a reformer, not a radical. Abolishing land ownership doesn’t require either communism on one end or hunter-gathering on the other. That’s because land can be separated from the things we do on top of it, whether that’s growing crops or building tower blocks. Colloquially, the term “landowner” often combines actual land-owning with several additional functions: putting up buildings, providing maintenance, and creating flexibility to live somewhere short-term. These additional services are valuable, but they’re an ever smaller share of the cost of housing. In New York City, 46 percent of a typical home’s value is just the cost of the land it’s built on. In San Francisco its 52 percent; in Los Angeles, 61 percent. 

The key Georgist insight is that you can tax the “unimproved” value of land separately from everything else. Right now, if you improve some land (e.g., by building a house on it), you’ll pay extra taxes because of the increased value of your property. Under Georgism, you would pay the same tax for your home as for an equivalent vacant lot in the same location, because both your building and the vacant lot use the same amount of finite land.

Today, Georgism as a political movement has stagnated like a vacant lot. But one day, we believe, people will see Georgist taxation as not only economically efficient but morally righteous. 

THE RIGHT TO live is generally considered the first of the natural rights. But living requires physical space—a volume of at least several dozen liters for your body to occupy. It’s pointless to declare that someone has a right to something if they can’t acquire its basic prerequisites. For example, as a society we think everyone has a right to a fair trial; since you can’t meaningfully have a fair trial without a lawyer, if someone can’t afford a lawyer, we provide one.  Similarly, on planet Earth at least, occupying space necessarily implies occupying land. Upper-floor apartments or underground bunkers still need the rights to the land below or above them. Thus, the right to life is actually derivative of the more primal right to physical space—and the right to space is derivative of the right to land.",https://www.wired.com/story/land-ownership-morality-economics-georgism/,,,,,,,,
